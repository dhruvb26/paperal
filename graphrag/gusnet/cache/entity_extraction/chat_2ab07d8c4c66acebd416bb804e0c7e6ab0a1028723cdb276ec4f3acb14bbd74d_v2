The domain-specific\nnature of BABE may limit its effectiveness for gen-\neralizing across a broader range of biases.\n4.3 Parameter Sensitivity Study To identify the\noptimal focal loss parameters, α and γ, we conducted\na sensitivity study by testing various values for each\nparameter while holding the other constant. As shown\nin Table 5, we evaluated the performance of the model\nat different α values while keeping γ fixed at 2. The\nresults indicate that the best-performing value for α\nwas 0.65, which resulted in improved F1-Scores across\nall entity types. Table 6 shows the influence of γ\nparameter while maintaining α at 0 .65. The results\nreveal that the macro-average F1-Score remained at\n0.80, indicating that this combination of parameters\neffectively balances sensitivity and specificity across\nentity types. Overall, the sensitivity study highlights\nthe importance of tuning the focal loss parameters to\nimprove the model’s performance in identifying various\nbiases. The optimal values used in this paper ( α = 0.65\nand γ = 2) demonstrate the model’s ability to adapt\nto class imbalances and enhance its performance in\ndetecting biased entities.\n4.4 Case Study To demonstrate our model’s label-\ning capabilities and generalizability, we present a case\nstudy involving religious bias from the GUS dataset.\nIn Figure 6(a), we provide an example of a statement\nAll Christians believe in an outdated fairy tale called the BibleStereotypesUnfairnessGeneralizations\nB-STEREO, B-GEN I-STEREO, I-GEN I-STEREOI-STEREOI-STEREOI-STEREO, B-UNFAIRI-STEREO, I-UNFAIRI-STEREO, I-UNFAIRI-STEREOI-STEREOI-STEREO\n(a) Example annotations in GUS Dataset and its corresponding meaning \nAtheists are so close mindedStereotypesUnfairnessGeneralizations\n(b) Example predictions given by GUS-Net on thetestdata\nB-STEREO, B-GEN I-STEREOI-STEREOI-STEREO, B-UNFAIRI-STEREO, I-UNFAIR\nFigure 6: Example of GUS dataset and GUS-Net\nPredictions.\nthat exhibits religious bias, along with the correspond-\ning labels generated by GUS-Net. Figure 6(b) show-\ncases GUS-Net’s outputs for this case study, illustrating\nits ability to accurately identify and classify instances\nof religious bias. The outputs are represented visually,\nhighlighting how the model distinguishes between differ-\nent types of bias, including Generalizations, Unfairness,\nand Stereotypes. This example indicates the effective-\nness of GUS-Net in generalizing across various forms of\nbias, reinforcing its potential as a robust tool for bias\ndetection in diverse contexts.\n5 Conclusion and Discussion\nThe proposed GUS-Net model addresses limitations in\nexisting bias detection methods by focusing on the nu-\nanced identification of social biases with semantic cat-\negories of generalizations, unfairness, and stereotypes.\nMoreover, GUS-Net uses a multi-label token classifi-\ncation architecture, based on bert-base-uncased, that\nallows entities to span multiple tokens and be nested\nwithin each other. GUS-Net approaches bias with three\ndetailed entities, offering a more granular and precise\ndetection of social biases. This enables better insights\ninto the structural components of biased language. Our\nresults demonstrate that GUS-Net performs well at clas-\nsifying tokens as each of the entities, with a notable\nstrength in detecting stereotypes. In sum, GUS-Net\ncontributes the field of bias detection in NLP by incor-\nporating a fine-grained and multi-faceted view of biased\nlanguage.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank OpenAI for providing us with API credits\nunder the Researcher Access program.\nCopyright © 2025 by SIAM\nUnauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\n\nPage 9\nReferences\n[1] L.
