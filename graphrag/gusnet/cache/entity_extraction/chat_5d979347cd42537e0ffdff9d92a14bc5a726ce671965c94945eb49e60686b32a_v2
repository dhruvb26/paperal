Each token sequence is padded to a length\nof 128 tokens, and the corresponding labels are mapped\nto ensure proper alignment. By reducing the input\nsize from the default 512 tokens to 128, we optimize\nthe modelâ€™s computational efficiency without sacrificing\nperformance for typical sentence lengths in the dataset.\n3.2.2 Loss Function Given the significant class im-\nbalance in our dataset, where certain entities like\nSTEREO are underrepresented compared to frequent\nentities like O, we employed focal loss to address this\nchallenge [22]. Standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)\ntends to focus on the majority class, leading to poor\nperformance on rare classes. In this paper, we use fo-\ncal loss calculated over all tokens, defined as:\nFL(pt) = âˆ’Î±t(1 âˆ’ pt)Î³ log(pt)\nwhere pt is the predicted probability for the true class;\n(1 âˆ’pt)Î³ reduces the impact of well-classified examples,\nhelping the model prioritize rare or difficult examples; Î±\nbalances the contribution of positive and negative sam-\nples, ensuring underrepresented entities receive more fo-\ncus; Î³ down-weights well-classified examples, allowing\nthe model to concentrate on harder-to-predict instances.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Settings\nTask Description and Metrics. In this paper,\nwe performed a token-level multi-label classification\ntask, where each sentence is annotated with one or more\nlabels to facilitate the identification of biased entities\nacross token sequences. Token-level classification is es-\nsential for bias detection because biases can often be\nnuanced and context-dependent. By focusing on indi-\nvidual tokens, we can capture subtle implications and\nassociations that may be overlooked in a sentence-level\nanalysis. Moreover, we opted for multi-label classifica-\ntion instead of multi-class classification to better reflect\nthe complex nature of biases, that may fall into one or\nmany entity classes. A single-class approach, like the\none proposed for Nbias, would limit our ability to cap-\nture the diversity of biases present in the text, as a\nstatement may contain multiple biases simultaneously.\nMetrics. To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, we\nutilized a variety of metrics to assess its ability to\naccurately identify biased entities:\nâ€¢ Hamming Loss: This metric measures the frac-\ntion of incorrect labels over all tokens in the se-\nquence, accounting for multi-label classification. It\nis defined as:\nHamming Loss = 1\nL\nLX\ni=1\n1 (yi Ì¸= Ë†yi)\nwhere L is the total number of tokens, yi is the\ntrue label for the i-th token, Ë†yi is the predicted\nlabel, and 1 is an indicator function that evaluates\nwhether the true label differs from the prediction.\nâ€¢ Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: These metrics\nwere calculated at two levels: individually for\neach entity class and as a macro-average across all\nclasses. They are defined as follows:\nPrecision = T P\nT P+ F P, Recall = T P\nT P+ F N\nF1-Score = 2 Â· Precision Â· Recall\nPrecision + Recall\nwhere TP denotes true positives, FP denotes false\npositives, and FN denotes false negatives.\nGiven the imbalanced class distribution in our\ndataset, we evaluated both the macro-average perfor-\nmance of the model and individual entity-type-level\nmetrics. By treating B- and I- tags as a single entity\n(e.g., combining B-GEN and I-GEN predictions), we en-\nhance our evaluation of the modelâ€™s ability to detect the\nCopyright Â© 2025 by SIAM\nUnauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\n\nPage 6\nTable 3: Baseline Comparison of GUS-Net over Nbias w.r.t. both overall and entity-type-based F1, Precision and\nRecall.
