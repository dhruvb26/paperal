The num-\nber of biased words from BABE was then normalized\nby dividing by the sentence length.\nThe scatter plot in Figure 5 reveals a positive corre-\nlation between the normalized number of biased words\nfrom the BABE dataset and the normalized minimum\nnumber of biased entities predicted by our model. This\ntrend suggests that our model’s understanding of bias\naligns well with the definitions established in the BABE\ndataset, indicating that GUS-Net effectively captures\nTable 4: Ablation study by comparing the influence of\nGUS dataset and focal loss.\nMetrics GUS-Net GUS-Net w.o.\nGUS dataset\nGUS-Net w.o.\nfocal loss\nPrecision 0.82 0.02 0.93\nRecall 0.77 0.22 0.63\nF1-Score 0.80 0.05 0.68\nHamming Loss 0.05 0.26 0.06\nand represents social biases present in the text.\n4.2.3 Ablation Study We conducted an ablation\nstudy to evaluate the impact of different configura-\ntions on the model’s performance. Table 4 presents the\nmacro-average Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Ham-\nming Loss for the following settings: (1) Our pro-\nposed GUS-Net model; (2) GUS-Net without GUS\ndataset: This configuration relies on an existing cor-\npus, BABE [27]. Since there are no token-level annota-\ntions for BABE, we used the same annotation pipeline\noutlined in this paper. (3) GUS-Net without focal\nloss: In this configuration, we trained the model using\nthe Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss function.\nFrom the results in Table 4, we have the following\nobservations:\n• Our proposed architecture, GUS-Net, outper-\nforms the other configurations across nearly all\nkey performance metrics. Specifically, GUS-Net\nachieves the highest macro-average Precision (0.82)\nand F1-Score (0.80), along with the lowest Ham-\nming Loss (0.05), indicating its superior ability to\naccurately identify and classify entities with min-\nimal misclassifications. The high Precision and\nF1-Score suggest that GUS-Net effectively reduces\nfalse positives while maintaining a strong balance\nbetween Precision and Recall.\n• In contrast, substituting focal loss for BCE resulted\nin a moderate Precision of 0.65. Upon further in-\nspection of the metrics for each entity individually,\nwe found that the macro-average metrics were dis-\ntorted by the class imbalance of the ‘O’ tags. Es-\nsentially, the model learns to prioritize predicting\n‘O’ tags correctly, which detracts from its focus on\nthe new classes of interest. This observation em-\nphasizes the importance of employing a loss func-\ntion and architecture specifically designed to han-\ndle class imbalance, as seen in GUS-Net, ensuring\nmore accurate and reliable model performance.\n• Interestingly, using the BABE dataset as the un-\nderlying corpus for annotation and training yielded\npoor results.
