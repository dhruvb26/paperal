In addition\nto a synthetic data annotation pipeline, we also use a\nlanguage model to synthetically generate the underlying\ncorpus for better coverage and structural consistency of\nthe entities we aim to classify [17, 20, 11]. The overall\ndataset generation pipeline can be found in Figure 1.\n3.1.1 Corpus Creation Since no existing dataset\nincludes the specific entities of generalizations, unfair-\nness, and stereotypes, we created a synthetic corpus of\nstatements and questions. To ensure coverage across\nmultiple domains, we developed four lists to utilize in\nprompting: Type of bias, target group, statement type,\nand sentiment, as shown in Table 1.\nUsing Mistral-7B [15], selected for its lack of\nguardrails, we generated prompts by combining values\nfrom each list. This process was applied with different\nprompt templates and types of statements for both bi-\nased and fair statements. The prompt template used for\nbiased statement generation is illustrated in Figure 1(a).\nFor the generation of 1,294 fair statements, the\nSentiment was modified to indicate either “slightly pos-\nitive yet fair” or “slightly negative yet fair.” Responses\nwere formatted in JSON for easier parsing and storage.\nWhile an authentic corpus could be used for annotation\nand training, the synthetic corpus created offers two key\nadvantages: a broader scope that balances domains and\na rich density of targeted parts of speech.\n3.1.2 Data Annotation The data annotation pro-\ncess involves several systematic steps to ensure accuracy\nand consistency in labeling the generated sentences. We\nutilized GPT-4o and the Stanford DSPy framework [19]\nto annotate the generated sentences with entity labels,\nfollowing methodologies in recent literature for anno-\ntation with agents [24]. As shown in Figure 1(b), the\nannotation can be summarized in the following steps:\n• Preparation of annotation : We recompiled a\nDSPy agent for each entity type (e.g., generalization,\nunfairness, stereotype) as an agent to streamline the\nannotation process. Each agent contains the entity\ndefinition and four examples of correct annotations.\nThe prompts sent to an agent include the definition\nof the target entity along with the curated examples.\nUsing few-shot learning helps the agent understand the\ncontext and provides guidance for accurate labeling [5,\n4, 6, 16]. Their definitions are provided in Table 2.\n• Annotation by agents : Each generated sentence\nis processed by an agent supported by a language\nmodel (LLM) for a single type of entity. We included\na Suggestions feature to ensure correct word/label\nalignment, that allows for backtracking and corrections.\nThe agent evaluates the sentence for the presence of\nthe specified entity and assigns appropriate labels. The\nagent produces a list of NER tags for each sentence,\nindicating the presence or absence of the entity types.\n• Summarizing module: After annotating for one en-\ntity type, we aggregate the labels into a comprehensive\ntwo-dimensional list. Each sub-list contains one or mul-\ntiple tags corresponding to each token in the sentence.\n• Final compilation: The individual entity labels from\neach annotation are systematically combined to create\nCopyright © 2025 by SIAM\nUnauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\n\nPage 4\nTable 2: Definitions used by annotator agents, and the corresponding entity labels.\nClass Prompt Definition Entity Label\nGeneralizations Any broad generalization of a group or ubiquitous classifiers,\nincluding adjectives/descriptors.\nB-GEN, I-GEN\nUnfairness Any harsh or unjust characterization or offensive language.B-UNFAIR, I-UNFAIR\nStereotypes Any statement (multiple words) that contains a stereotype\ntargeting a group of people, both explicitly and unconsciously.\nB-STEREO, I-STEREO\nNeutral - O\nRacial\n239\nReligious\n244\nGender\n392\nAge\n275\nNationality\n359\nSexuality\n201\nSocioeconomic\n310\nEducational\n209\nDisability\n182\nPolitical\n282 Physical\n152\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
