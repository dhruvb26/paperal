This framework is aimed at addressing explicit biases and aiming to detect implicit biases, making it a significant tool in the field of bias detection. It serves as a baseline model for comparison against other methods, such as GUS-Net, to evaluate performance in bias detection. By incorporating the entity “BIAS” into NER, NBIAS provides a comprehensive approach to identifying and analyzing both explicit and implicit biases within text, showcasing its innovative contribution to enhancing bias detection methodologies.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1734484901, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 327, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
