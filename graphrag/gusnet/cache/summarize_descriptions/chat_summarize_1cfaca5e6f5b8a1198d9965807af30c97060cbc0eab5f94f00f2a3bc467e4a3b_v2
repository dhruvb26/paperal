It is widely recognized for its application in multi-label token classification models. As a pre-trained model, BERT is utilized to enhance bias detection across diverse types of text, making it a valuable tool in the field of natural language processing. Additionally, it is employed by GUS-Net for fine-tuning in tasks related to multi-label token classification. This innovative approach leverages the power of bidirectional training, allowing the model to understand the context of words in a sentence more effectively than traditional methods.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1734484901, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 129, "prompt_tokens": 213, "total_tokens": 342, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
