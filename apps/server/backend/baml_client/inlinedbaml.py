However,  most  of  the  research\\nundertaken to date has focused on environmental pollution, while other topics in environmental\\neconomics, such as the preservation of natural resources, have not warranted much attention in the\\noptimal taxation literature. This paper uses a simple general-equilibrium model to analyze the welfare\\neffects of taxes on final goods, taxes on natural resources, and extraction permits with a second-best\\napproach based on the existence of initial distortionary taxes. This analysis not only takes into account\\nthe non-use utility of the mere existence of natural resources, but also captures the consequences of\\nenjoying environmental goods on labor supply decisions, through the use-value attributed to natural\\nresources. The comparison of the welfare impacts of a tax on final consumption and a tax on the use\\nof natural resources is not conclusive. A consumption tax leads to a higher primary welfare effect\\nthan a resources tax, while taxing natural goods generates more revenue-recycling income than taxing\\nconsumption goods. In addition, as extraction permits do not generate new public revenues to reduce\\npre-existing distortionary taxes, this intervention entails the highest welfare costs.\\nKeywords:environmental regulation; natural resources; tax-interaction effects; use and non-use value\\n1. Introduction\\nIn  the  last  three  decades,  researchers  have  become  increasingly  interested  in  analyzing\\nenvironmental taxation in economies with pre-existing taxes and identifying the efficiency of different\\nenvironmental policy instruments. Particular attention has been paid to the effects of environmental\\ntaxation on welfare by extending the traditional (partial-equilibrium) analysis with additional economic\\ninteractions through the use of a broader (general-equilibrium) perspective.\\nThe latest findings in this area of public economics not only suggest that policy recommendations\\nfrom  partial-equilibrium  analysis  are  misleading  and  incorrect,  but  also  warn  that  conclusions\\nfrom  general-equilibrium  analysis  that  ignore  pre-existing  distortions  can  be  highly  imprecise.\\nThe cornerstone of this body of research is the idea that pre-existing taxes raise the cost of environmental\\ninterventions and that this impact is not completely offset by the possible substitution of pre-existing\\ntaxes  with  new  environmental  taxes.   This  set  of  contributions  highlights  the  existence  of  three\\ndifferentiated welfare effects when a new environmental tax is implemented:  theprimary welfare\\neffect,  which  is  the  direct  (partial-equilibrium)  impact  of  the  new  taxation  on  the  environmental\\nexternality; therevenue-recycling effect, which captures the benefit of replacing pre-existing distortionary\\ntaxes with the new pollution taxes; and finally, thecost-side tax-interaction effect, which measures the\\nnegative welfare impact of the price rises that is transmitted through the labor market by reducing\\nthe real wage and, consequently, discouraging labor supply [1–6]. Williams [7,8] added an additional\\nbenefit-side tax-interaction effect, which captures the positive effects of environmental taxation on health\\nand productivity,  and which can (partially or completely) offset the costs of taxation.   Schwartz\\nSustainability2020,12, 1562; doi:10.3390/su12041562www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 15622 of 17\\nand Repetto [9] implicitly represented health effects in the utility function, and treated the cost-side\\nand benefit-side tax-interaction effects together.   By contrast,  Williams’ contributions focused on\\nan explicit representation of health effects in utility and proposed a distinction between the two\\ntax-interaction effects.\\nThe literature on optimal taxation to date has mainly focused on the analysis of environmental\\npollution. However, environmental economics faces other challenges that have not yet been addressed\\nby second-best taxation research. In particular, to the best of my knowledge, no studies have analyzed\\nthe regulation of natural resources within this area of public economics.\\nSome specific aspects of natural resources need to be mentioned, such as the distinction between\\nrenewable and exhaustible resources, the creation of incentives to promote their efficient use and\\npreservative  extraction,  and  the  need  for  a  correct  pricing  policy  to  capture  the  real  cost  of  use.\\nThe distinction between renewable and non-renewable resources, while very common in the literature,\\nis somewhat imprecise, since both types of resource can be exhausted if the natural rules of replenishable\\nresources are not guaranteed [10].  Natural resources are also highly heterogeneous and can vary\\nwidely in terms of their particular biological laws,  their specific environment,  their possible use\\nby individuals and their usefulness in the production system.  From an environmental economic\\nperspective,  problems related to natural resources relate to management issues coping with (the\\npossibility of) overexploitation and depletion, on the one hand, and alleviating the (possible) negative\\nexternalities involved, on the other.  Externalities linked to the exploitation of natural resources are\\nenvironmental damages such as the loss of recreational areas and beauty, endangering the quality of\\nsoil to grow forests and crops, and reducing air quality. Additionally, the significance of these impacts\\non natural goods can be exacerbated by the institutional characteristics of the appropriation process.\\nIn particular, as is stated by public economics, a common property that turns resources into unpriced\\ncommodities requires the creation of market instruments to ensure that resources are efficiently used\\nby the economic system.\\nMoreover, from a consumer ’s point of view, most stocks of natural resources such as fish or forests\\nare not just commodities used as inputs in production, since these resources also contribute to the\\nstability of ecological systems and provide environmental services to individuals. Resources therefore\\naffect private welfare not only indirectly, but also directly. In particular, the literature has highlighted\\ntwo ways in which natural resources have an effect on welfare: the use value and the non-use value [11].\\nThe use value is associated with the recreational services that individuals enjoy by directly using\\nnatural resources.  The non-use value, which is difficult to measure, is those services provided by\\nnatural resources and ecosystems, and their indirect contribution to the well-being of individuals.\\nThis welfare component of policies is of particular interest if various initiatives have been put\\nforward to ensure the preservation of natural resources.  With this in mind, the approach adopted\\nhere is a general-equilibrium analysis of welfare effects that focuses on some of the implications of\\nboth the market and the non-market use of natural resources. In particular, in the model proposed,\\nthe production system makes natural resources available for the market. Non-market usage includes\\nboth the use value and the non-use value of natural resources beyond the rules of markets and prices.\\nAt first, economic models of natural resources were static in nature.  For instance, White [12]\\ncontains a complete review of the economic studies on renewable biological resources in the literature.\\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, studies started to use dynamic models that mostly focus on the long-term\\ncapacity for regeneration and preservation. For instance, Heaps [13] discussed the theory of optimal\\ntaxation for non-replenishable resources and the associated effects of the various policies on the\\nextraction plans. Using an overlapping generations model, Gerlah and Keyzer [14] compared different\\npolicy scenarios to be applied in the case of an exhaustible resource with amenity values. More recently,\\nValente [15] studied resources’ preservation and intergenerational distribution mechanisms in the\\ncontext of human capital accumulation.\\nAlthough problems of (the possible) depletion and intergenerational redistribution mechanisms\\nof  natural  resources  are  inherently  dynamic,  there  are  at  least  three  situations  in  which  there  is\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 15623 of 17\\nno connection between different generations, so static methods are appropriate [16]:  the lengthy\\nreproduction of natural goods (such as forests of slow-growing species), the high mobility of resources\\n(such  as  migratory  wildlife),  and  a  reproductive  size  in  one  generation  that  has  no  impact  on\\nsubsequent population size (such as harvestable fish). Furthermore, the static framework has proven to\\nbe extremely useful for making in-depth studies of the welfare implications of environmental measures.\\nBy considering all these potentialities, this paper presents a static analysis of the alternative measures\\navailable for preserving natural resources and the welfare impacts involved. The approach used can\\nbe regarded as complementary to dynamic analyses. Using optimal taxation, the approach focuses\\non the welfare consequences of taxes on final consumption goods, taxes on the intermediate uses of\\nnatural resources and, finally, non-auctioned extraction permits for natural resources.\\nThis analysis extends the existing literature in several ways.  First, it uses the environmental\\ngeneral-equilibrium framework to study natural resources by defining a second-best setting in which\\nthere is an initial and distortionary tax on income.   Second,  it explores the welfare effects of the\\nalternative measures available for correcting the negative impacts caused by the usage of natural\\nresources (i.e., overexploitation and the possible negative externalities involved).  Third, it aims to\\ncapture some of the economy-wide implications of the non-market usages of natural resources by\\ndefining the trade-offbetween labor supply decisions and the use-value of ecosystem services. In the\\nproposed model, this trade-offis captured by a distinction between the time devoted to enjoying nature,\\nwhich is directly related to the amount of natural resources available, and other types of leisure that do\\nnot depend on the use of environmental goods.\\nThe comparison of alternative policies shows that the contribution of the different (general-\\nequilibrium) components to welfare depends on the policy instrument applied. In particular, a tax on\\nnatural resources involves a lower primary welfare effect and a higher revenue-recycling effect than a\\ntax on final goods. Moreover, the implementation of extraction permits leads to higher welfare costs\\nthan direct taxation on natural resources, given that, in this case, there are no new public revenues to\\nreduce pre-existing distortionary taxes.\\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes a general-equilibrium\\nmodel that is subsequently used to analyze the welfare effects of various policies that can be implemented\\nto preserve the resources provided by ecosystems.  After presenting the policy implications of the\\nanalysis, the final section draws the conclusions.\\n2. The Model\\nThe model assumes a representative household with utility from two consumption goods (Xand\\nY).  The production ofXrequires the use of natural resources, while the production ofYdoes not.\\nHouseholds also enjoy utility from two types of leisure:l, which is not related to environmental goods,\\nandE\\n(\\nN\\n)\\n, which depends on the amount of natural resources available (N). Finally, the households’\\nutility also comes from the amount of natural resources. The utility function can be written as\\nU\\n(\\nV\\n(\\nX,Y,l,E\\n(\\nN\\n))\\n,N\\n)\\n(1)\\nwhich is quasi-concave and continuous. Sub-functionVcombines market goods, leisure and natural\\nresources to derive the utility from the use-based values.   In addition,  the utility function in (1)\\nassumes that resources are separable from consumption and leisure, and thus reflects the non-use\\nvalue associated with natural resources. This representation is very common in the previous theoretical\\nliterature,  which  defines  environmental  quality  as  a  separate  argument  in  utility  [1,2,7,8,17–19].\\nAn alternative approach [9,20], relaxed this assumption by using a non-separable utility function.\\nConsumers divide their total time endowment (T) in the following way\\nT=L+l+E\\n(\\nN\\n)\\n(2)\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 15624 of 17\\nwhereLis labour,lis leisure andE\\n(\\nN\\n)\\nrepresents the leisure time spent enjoying the services provided\\nby nature, which increases inN:\\n∂E\\n∂N\\n>0.  The time spent using ecosystem services corresponds to\\na notion of use-value [21].  From expression (2), the demand for leisure related to natural resources\\nreduces the time available for work and leisure that does not depend on natural goods.E\\n(\\nN\\n)\\nrepresents\\nthe demand for recreational services that comprise, for instance, time for sports, and leisure that is\\ndirectly linked to natural goods.\\nNatural resources are also used in the production of goodX, and this assumption captures the\\nmarket usages of resources. The production functions of the two consumption goods take the form\\nX=F\\nX\\n(\\nL\\nX\\n,I\\n)\\n(3)\\nY=F\\nY\\n(\\nL\\nY\\n)\\n(4)\\nIn expressions (3) and (4),L\\nX\\nandL\\nY\\nrepresent the labour used in the production ofXandY\\nrespectively, andL\\nX\\n+L\\nY\\n=L.  In addition,Irepresents the amount ofNused as an input in the\\nproduction of goodX. Production in both industries is assumed to be competitive.\\nIf the production functions are not homogeneous to a degree of one, production will generate\\nprofits (π) that are assumed to be an income of households. By normalising wages to one, the profits\\ncan be expressed as follows\\nπ=P\\nX\\nX+P\\nY\\nY−L\\nX\\n−L\\nY\\n−P\\nI\\nI(5)\\nwhereP\\nX\\nandP\\nY\\nare the prices ofXandY, respectively, andP\\nI\\nis the price of natural resources used as\\ninputs in production.\\nThe production and consumption of goodXgenerates a negative impact on the environment,\\nthus affecting (i.e., reducing) the availability of natural resources. In the model, the amount of natural\\nresources is equal to the difference between an initial given stock (N) minus the quantity of resources\\nused by the production system (I), the units of which are equivalent, so that the use of one unit ofI\\nreduces the amount of natural resources by exactly one unit in the form\\nN=N−I(6)\\nwhereI≤N, so thatN≥0.  AsNis fixed, expression (6) illustrates a broad set of resource-setting\\nsituations such as a non-renewable natural good, a long reproductive framework that converts current\\nresources into invariable stock in the short–medium term, high resource mobility, and pre-reproductive\\nmortality in a current population that does not affect subsequent population size. In all these cases,\\nexpression (6) encompasses two possible scenarios:  an initial stock that is not enough to satisfy all\\nneeds, which leads to a depletion problem and, alternatively, a stock big enough to satisfy all needs,\\nwhich leads to a natural resource management problem.\\nIn  the  initial  situation,  there  is  only  one  (pre-existing)  tax  in  the  economy,  which  taxes  all\\nhouseholds’ income (labor earnings and profits) at a proportional tax rateτ\\nL\\n. The household budget\\nconstraint is, therefore, equal to\\n(\\n1−τ\\nL\\n)(\\nL+π\\n)\\n+G=P\\nX\\nX+P\\nY\\nY(7)\\nIn this expression,Gis a government lump-sum transfer to households and is equal to\\nG=τ\\nL\\n(\\nL+π\\n)\\n(8)\\nwhich is held constant in real terms.\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 15625 of 17\\nHouseholds  maximize  the  utility  function  (1)  subject  to  the  time  constraint  (2)  and  budget\\nconstraint (7), and the income tax rate, the government transfers, the price of final goods and damages\\non natural resources are taken as given. This yields the first-order conditions for consumers\\nU\\nV\\nV\\nX\\n=λP\\nX\\nU\\nV\\nV\\nY\\n=λP\\nY\\nU\\nV\\nV\\nl\\n=λ(1−τ\\nL\\n)(1+\\ndE\\ndl\\n)\\nU\\nV\\nV\\nE\\nE\\nN\\n=λ(1−τ\\nL\\n)(1+\\ndl\\ndE\\n)\\nwhere the subscripts onU,VandEdenote partial derivatives,λis the Lagrange multiplier or the\\nmarginal utility of income, and the terms\\ndl\\ndE\\nand\\ndE\\ndl\\nmeasure the degree of substitutability between\\nthe two categories of leisure.   These terms are obtained by totally differentiating the consumers’\\ntime restriction, and using the expressions\\ndL\\ndl\\n=−\\n(\\n1+\\ndE\\ndl\\n)\\nand\\ndL\\ndE\\n=−\\n(\\n1+\\ndl\\ndE\\n)\\n.  The corresponding\\n(Marshallian) uncompensated demand functions for the consumption goods and leisure are obtained\\nfrom these consumers’ first-order conditions, together with the households’ time restriction (2) and the\\nhouseholds’ budget constraint (7)\\nX\\n(\\nP\\nX\\n,P\\nY\\n,τ\\nL\\n,π,N\\n)\\n;Y\\n(\\nP\\nX\\n,P\\nY\\n,τ\\nL\\n,π,N\\n)\\n;l\\n(\\nP\\nX\\n,P\\nY\\n,τ\\nL\\n,π,N\\n)\\n;E\\n(\\nP\\nX\\n,P\\nY\\n,τ\\nL\\n,π,N\\n)\\nNote that as the public lump-sum transfer to consumersGis assumed to be constant in real terms,\\nit is not included as an argument in the demand functions for consumption and leisure.\\nThe equilibrium of the model requires that demand (for goods and labor) must be equal to supply,\\nand government revenues equal to government transfers.\\n3. Tax on Final Goods\\nResearch into measures to reduce pollution when taxes are already in place has mainly focused\\non introducing new taxation on the final (polluting) goods. The general-equilibrium model presented\\nabove provides the means to measure the welfare effects of a tax on consumption goods, which is\\nimplemented to preserve the stock of natural resources.\\nConsider a tax rateτ\\nX\\nper unit of consumption ofX.  As this new taxation is a disincentive to\\nconsuming and producing harmful goods, environmental damage will be reduced (i.e., fewer natural\\nresources will be used as inputs of production).  This intervention is consistent with the idea that\\nenvironmental responsibility is attributable to consumers and, accordingly, taxation should be levied\\non the agents assumed to generate the negative impact on the environment. From a practical point of\\nview, this measure is applicable when the use of natural resources cannot be directly taxed because the\\nuse of resources is completely free. In other words, the tax on consumption could be implemented in\\nthe absence of prices or other market instruments for natural resources, which do not allow economic\\nagents to directly control its use.\\nNote that in this situation of taxation, in conjunction with the null control of natural resource\\nusages, expression (5) for firms’ profits reduces to\\nπ= (P\\nX\\n−τ\\nX\\n)X+P\\nY\\nY−L\\nX\\n−L\\nY\\n(5a)\\nTaking into account the new tax definition, the (fixed) government constraint is now equal to\\nG=τ\\nL\\n(\\nL+π\\n)\\n+τ\\nX\\nX(8a)\\nwhereτ\\nX\\nis the revenue-neutral tax imposed onX, with revenues used to finance reductions inτ\\nL\\n.\\nIn other words, as the level of government spendingGis given, revenues from the final consumption\\ntax are used to compensate for a cut in the taxation on income. In a static model with only one final\\ngood, a tax swap that raises taxation on that good and lowers income tax would have no effect. To avoid\\nthis isomorphism, the model considers another final (non-taxed) goodY.\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 15626 of 17\\nFirms choose the input quantities according to their profit maximization behavior.

More  recently,  Gahvari  [23]  provided  a  clarification  of  the  concept  of\\nPigouvian tax.\\nIn the natural resources context used in this paper, the Pigouvian tax should be broadly interpreted\\nas a prescription to correct those environmental damages associated with the use of natural goods.\\nIn Equation (10),μis equal to\\nμ=\\n[\\nτ\\nL\\n−\\n(\\n1−τ\\nL\\n)\\ndE\\ndl\\n]\\n∂l\\n∂τ\\nL\\n(\\nL+π\\n)\\n−τ\\nL\\n(\\n∂l\\n∂τ\\nL\\n+\\n∂E\\n∂τ\\nL\\n)\\n+1(11)\\nwhich is defined as themarginal cost of public funds, and shows the efficiency cost of an additional\\nmonetary  unit  of  public  revenues  obtained  by  increasing  the  labor  tax  rate.   In  this  expression,\\nthe quotient is the welfare loss from a marginal increase in the labor tax per monetary unit of new\\nrevenue.   The numerator is the marginal rise in taxation and the denominator is the increase in\\ngovernment revenues from a marginal increase inτ\\nL\\n.  Then, the cost to consumers is equal to the\\ndeadweight loss (the quotient) plus the additional income (one) of a marginal increase in income\\ntaxation.  This is a well-known partial-equilibrium definition because it does not take into account\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 15627 of 17\\nthe indirect effects of labor taxation on the revenues obtained from the new tax, and quantifies the\\nmarginal welfare damage associated with labor taxation.\\nExpression  (10)  above  shows  a  decomposition  of  the  welfare  effects  into  four  different\\ncomponents [7,8] in a second-best context of pollutant emissions.   The first of these,dW\\nP\\n,  is the\\nprimary welfare effectcontaining the partial-equilibrium impact of implementingτ\\nX\\n.  This impact is\\nthe difference between the reduction in consumption goodXafter a marginal increase in taxation\\nmultiplied by the private costs of taxation,  and the damage to natural goods (the Pigouvian tax\\nmultiplied by the marginal change in natural resources), which is the marginal social benefit. Typically,\\nthe literature has defined the marginal social benefits on pollution of a consumption tax in relation\\nto an indirect measure, that is, the reduction in the consumption of polluting goods.  The marginal\\nbenefit in expression (10), however, is defined by means of a direct measure affecting the negative\\nenvironmental impacts, which is the marginal change in the amount of natural resources.\\nThe second component in expression (10),dW\\nR\\n, is the well-knownrevenue-recycling effector the\\nimprovement in efficiency of using the income from the new tax to decrease the distortionary labor tax.\\nThis (positive) effect is equal to the marginal revenue from the new tax (in square brackets) multiplied\\nby the welfare loss due to income taxation:\\n(\\nμ−1\\n)\\n.\\nThe last two components in (10) show the impact of the new taxation on labor supply decisions.\\nUnlike previous contributions, these two elements extend the labor-consumption choice to include\\nleisure  related  to  recreational  resources.    In  particular,  the  elementdW\\nC\\ncaptures  thecost-side\\ntax-interaction  effectand  reflects  the  negative  impact  that  the  consumption  tax  has  on  the  labor\\nmarket by increasing final prices, reducing the real wage and discouraging labor supply from two\\ndifferent channels (the encouragement of leisure not related to nature, typically reflected in the literature,\\nand the encouragement of leisure related to natural goods). Finally,dW\\nB\\nis thebenefit-side tax-interaction\\neffect, which expresses the impact on labor supply decisions arising from changes in benefits and\\nchanges in the amount of natural resources. In this model, therefore, the impacts of a consumption\\ntax on labor supply decisions come from two different sources: the effects on leisure that depends on\\nnatural goods (E) and the effects on other types of leisure (l). Given that labour supply decisions are\\naffected by the amount of recreational resources, any change inNwill have consequences on welfare,\\nwhich will be reflected in the componentdW\\nB\\n.\\nAny change in the consumption-leisure choice leads to a general-equilibrium impact on welfare.\\nThere are two reasons for this. First, as income tax revenue is directly related to labor supply, any increase\\n(decrease) in the labor supply generates an increase (decrease) in taxation revenue. Changes in labor\\ntherefore require the tax rate to be modified in the opposite direction to compensate for income tax\\nrevenues. Second, as the private cost of leisure (wage net of taxation) is lower than its social cost (pre-tax\\nwage), any rise in leisure (i.e., fall in labor) causes a loss in welfare. The cost-side tax-interaction effect\\nreflects the sum of these two components of the environmental tax, and the benefit-side tax-interaction\\neffect reflects a similar sum due to the increase in natural resources. Note that ifN=0, then the results\\nare equivalent to those reported in the literature:dW\\nC\\nis limited to showing the impacts ofτ\\nX\\nonland\\ndW\\nB\\nis limited to showing the impacts ofτ\\nX\\non profits.\\nIf the amount of natural resources increases, there is a corresponding increase in the demand for\\nrecreational services (E), which reduces the time available for work (L) and for leisure not directly\\nrelated to natural resources (l).  If the reduction in the remaining time materialises in a reduction\\nin leisure, there is a positive impact on welfare that could offset the cost-side tax-interaction effect.\\nHowever, if the extra time devoted to using ecosystem services is offset by a reduction in the labor\\nsupply while leisure remains at its initial level, there is a negative welfare effect that reinforces the\\ncost-side tax-interaction effect.   Consequently,  the sign of the benefit-side tax-interaction effect is\\nambiguous, and will depend on how consumers reallocate the reduction in time between labor and\\nleisure when the amount of natural resources changes. Although this result is consistent with [7,8],\\nthe impact of an improved environment is originated in the opposite direction.

Tax on Natural Resources\\nThe overexploitation and depletion of some types of natural resources, such as timber, fish or\\nminerals, is directly related to their use as inputs within the production system. In this section, let us\\nassume that the government levies a revenue-neutral ad-valorem taxτ\\nI\\non the natural resources used\\nin production. Implicitly, taxing the resources directly means that the public agent can control firms’\\naccess and usage. This intervention is therefore consistent with a situation in which market instruments\\nfor resources are available and can be used in order to encourage their efficient use. More specifically,\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 15629 of 17\\nthe idea that environmental responsibility falls on production, together with the government’s ability to\\ncontrol access to the use of natural resources, would justify the implementation of this kind of measure.\\nIn this situation, the taxation on natural resources modifies firms’ profits in the following way\\nπ=P\\nX\\nX+P\\nY\\nY−L\\nX\\n−L\\nY\\n−P\\nI\\n(\\n1+τ\\nI\\n)\\nI(5b)\\nAs this policy levies taxation on production, the consumers’ budget constraint coincides with\\nexpression (7) for the initial situation.

Note that,\\nas taxation is levied on production, the (partial-equilibrium) private costs of consumption are null\\nunder this intervention.\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 156210 of 17\\nThe second component,dW\\nR\\n, is therevenue-recycling effectand shows the efficiency gain of using\\nthe new tax revenue to reduce the labor tax. This effect is equal to the welfare loss of income taxation\\n(\\nμ−1\\n)\\nmultiplied by the revenues obtained from the new tax (in square brackets). The tax revenues\\nare now defined in terms of the inputs used by the production system (I) because the tax is levied on\\nthe use of natural resources.\\nIn  expression  (14),dW\\nC\\nanddW\\nB\\nare,  respectively,  thecost-side  tax-interaction  effectand  the\\nbenefit-side tax-interaction effect. The former shows how the increase in final prices reduces real wages\\nand thus has a negative impact on labor supply decisions and diminishes labor supply.  The latter\\nshows the effects on the labor market of changes in benefits, changes in the amount of natural resources\\nand changes in the use of recreational services by consumers.\\nThe comparison of the welfare impacts of an (indirect) intervention affecting final consumption and\\na (direct) measure affecting the use of natural resources shows two types of significant difference (see\\nTable 1 for details). First, it is important to note the different roles played by the private costs associated\\nwith each policy, which disappear in the event of a tax implemented on production.  Consequently,\\ntaxing the inputs used by the production system exacerbates the partial-equilibrium welfare losses\\nin relation to implementing taxation on consumption.  Second, the revenue-recycling effects of the\\ntwo interventions differ.  Specifically, a market mechanism that defines a tax onIimplies a higher\\nrevenue-recycling income than a tax on final consumption, because the assumption of resources owned\\nby the government implies a higher tax base.\\nThe comparison of expressions (10) and (14) therefore provides an ambiguous result that depends\\non which of the two effects dominates. A tax on natural resources has a lower primary welfare effect (a\\nhigher welfare loss) and a higher revenue-recycling effect than a tax on final goods, which has a higher\\nprimary effect (a higher welfare gain) and a lower revenue-recycling effect.\\nBy setting expression (14) equal to zero and solving forτ\\nI\\n, the optimal tax on natural resources is\\nequal to\\nτ\\n∗\\nI\\n=\\n−τ\\nP\\n(\\nμ−1\\n)\\n+\\n[\\nI\\ndN\\ndτ\\nI\\n−1\\n]\\n+\\n1\\n(\\nμ−1\\n)\\n[[\\ndE\\ndl\\n(\\n1−τ\\nL\\n)\\n−μτ\\nL\\n](\\n∂l\\n∂P\\nX\\ndP\\nX\\ndτ\\nI\\n+\\n∂l\\n∂P\\nY\\ndP\\nY\\ndτ\\nI\\n)\\n]\\n1\\ndN\\ndτ\\nI\\n−τ\\nL\\n(\\n∂E\\n∂P\\nX\\ndP\\nX\\ndτ\\nI\\n+\\n∂E\\n∂P\\nY\\ndP\\nY\\ndτ\\nI\\n)\\n1\\ndN\\ndτ\\nI\\n+\\n1\\n(\\nμ−1\\n)\\n[[\\n(\\n1−τ\\nL\\n)\\ndE\\ndl\\n−\\nμτ\\nL\\n]\\n(\\n∂l\\n∂π\\ndπ\\ndτ\\nI\\n+\\n∂l\\n∂N\\ndN\\ndτ\\nI\\n)]\\n1\\ndN\\ndτ\\nI\\n−\\n1\\n(\\nμ−1\\n)\\n[\\nμτ\\nL\\n(\\n∂E\\n∂π\\ndπ\\ndτ\\nI\\n+\\n∂E\\n∂N\\ndN\\ndτ\\nI\\n)\\n+\\n[\\n(\\n1−τ\\nL\\n)\\ndl\\ndE\\n+\\nτ\\nL\\n(\\n∂E\\n∂N\\n−1\\n)]\\n+τ\\nL\\n(\\nμ−1+\\n∂E\\n∂N\\n)\\ndπ\\ndτ\\nI\\n]\\n1\\ndN\\ndτ\\nI\\n(15)\\nThe first term on the right-hand side shows the (negative) contribution of social costs to optimal\\ntax.

Extraction Permits\\nAnother  instrument  that  can  be  used  to  protect  natural  resources  consists  of  implementing\\nnon-auctioned  extraction  permits  that  convert  resources  into  non-free  commodities  because  the\\nregulator quantitatively limits their use. This situation implicitly assumes that the government is able\\nto control access to the resources and accordingly defines an acceptable quantity that can be used by\\nagents. Parallel studies by Goulder et al. [17], Goulder et al. [18] and Parry et al. [19] analysed emission\\npermits (or quotas) in the context of a second-best general-equilibrium analysis of pollutant emissions.\\nImplementing a permits policy does not affect the initial optimization problem or the demand\\nfunctions of consumers.  Moreover, although the use of natural resources is quantitatively limited,\\nfirms do not pay for the use of natural inputs. This means that under this situation the benefits will\\nbe those in expression (5). The new government constraint is limited to showing revenues generated\\nby income tax (expression (8)). Unlike the preceding measures, therefore, this intervention does not\\ngenerate new public revenues. Consequently, the non-auctioned extraction permits do not allow for\\na reduction in the pre-existing labor taxation.  Freely allocated permits are chosen with the explicit\\npurpose of identifying the welfare impacts when the revenue-recycling effect is null.  If extraction\\npermits were auctioned, they would give rise to public revenues, and the policy effects would be the\\nsame as if a tax on natural resources were applied.\\nAccording to Goulder et al. [18], the permits policy can be represented as a virtual tax on resources,\\nwhich  discourages  production  because  firms  indirectly  support  the  burden  of  the  intervention.\\nThe virtual tax is based on the idea that firms indirectly receive the corresponding revenues from\\ntaxation in the form of economic rents due to the fact that reducing the amount of resources implies\\na reduction in output.

This expression shows theprimary\\nwelfare effect(dW\\nP\\n), which is the same as if the taxation was applied to natural resources (expression\\n(14)).  In addition, as the policy raises the price of consumption goods relative to leisure, there is a\\nreduction in real wages and a fall in the labor supply. These (negative) effects are captured by acost-side\\ntax-interaction effect(dW\\nC\\n). Moreover, thebenefit-side tax-interaction effect(dW\\nB\\n) shows the impacts of\\nextraction permits on labor supply decisions arising specifically from changes in profits and changes in\\nthe amount of natural resources.\\nThe only difference in terms of welfare between directly taxing resources and implementing\\nextraction permits (expressions (14) and (16)) lies with the revenue recycling effect, which disappears\\nunder  the  permits  policy  (see  Table  1).   Given  that  no  new  public  revenues  reduce  pre-existing\\ndistortionary taxes, the implementation of extraction permits leads to higher welfare costs than direct\\ntaxation on natural resources, and this result is consistent with [17–19].\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 156213 of 17\\n6. Policy Implications and Empirical Evaluation\\nThe theoretical framework proposed in this paper could draw some implications for real-world\\npolicy making. To date, the empirical analysis of environmental fiscal reforms has mainly focused on\\npollutant emissions and its consequences at both socioeconomic and environmental levels. Nonetheless,\\nthe progressive degradation of some natural resources, in direct consonance with the worldwide\\nincrease in the demand for natural goods and energy-related goods, has positioned the preservation of\\nresources at the forefront of environmental worries.\\nTaxes to preserve natural resources are implemented to discourage behavior that is potentially\\ndamaging  for  environmental  goods  and  this  provides  incentives  for  ecosystems’  preservation.\\nThis knowledge is important not only for areas such as environmental policy and environmental fiscal\\nreforms but also for analytical purposes. Following the ambiguity of the model results to discriminate\\namong the various instruments analyzed, taxes to preserve resources differ in their general-equilibrium\\nimpacts on welfare and this poses an undoubted interest in the specific effects that could be at stake\\nin real economies. That is, the use of applied models to test some of the theoretical results related to\\nnatural resources, such as the ones analyzed in this paper, is necessary in order to provide insights\\nregarding the way the different policy instruments work in real life.\\nHowever, the gap between theoretical analyses and the empirical world can only be covered if\\nadequate and updated data are available to precisely reflect the characteristics of the economy. Hence\\ngood quality data are essential for implementing the outcomes provided in this paper and these\\n(indispensable) data encompass not only economic variables but also environmental variables that\\nshould be accessible to researchers.\\nMoreover, the empirical applications require the specification of some particular issues such as\\nthe broad concepts of consumption taxation and natural resources taxation.  The former involves\\nvarious fiscal instruments linked to the use of natural resources by individuals, such as taxes on water\\nconsumption and taxes on activities related to recreational services (for instance, camping, hiking,\\nand fishing).  The latter involves taxation linked to the extraction and use of natural resources in\\nthe production system by firms, and comprises taxation on mineral extraction, taxes on timber or\\ndeforestation, taxes on land use or taxes on the production of resource-intensive goods, among others.\\nSpecific examples are the retail sales tax on recreational services applied in the Washington State,\\nthat includes charges for skydiving, ballooning, paragliding, day trips for sightseeing purposes, fishing,\\nplay golf, horseback riding, guided hunting, or shooting sports. In the European Union, some countries\\napply tourist taxes designed to preserve environmental goods, conserve resources and offset the\\npossible negative impacts of tourism. This is the case of the occupancy taxes that are applied in some\\nof Europe’s most popular destinations such as the city of Paris and many of the Spanish regions.\\nThe implementation of the model also requires the definition of the conceptual logic describing\\nthe different channels through which environmental goods interact with the economy. In particular,\\nthe distinction between the use and non-use value connected with natural resources at the empirical\\nlevel  requires  precise  and  complete  data  on  leisure  demand,  households’  preferences  structures\\nand flows of environmental inputs of production.  For the rest of variables involved in the model,\\nwhich describe the production technology and government budget structure, data availability is also\\nparamount to encompass empirical research.\\nFrom a methodological perspective, the transition from the theoretical model to an application\\nfor actual economies would be perfectly possible given that operational tools are available nowadays.\\nThis makes it is possible to adapt the complexity of the analytical concepts to the diversity and particular\\ncharacteristics of real economies.  In this vein, for example, Carbone and Smith [20] proposed an\\nanalytical and numerical model to evaluate the externalities due to reductions in air quality. In addition,\\ncomputational tools may provide results for individual regions (economies) or by groups of them.\\nDepending on model specification and the nature and quality of databases, empirical models can\\nestimate different economy-wide interrelations in which the geographic dimension could affect the\\nresults when natural resource policies are evaluated.\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 156214 of 17\\n7. Conclusions\\nPrevious research on measures to reduce environmental pollution has argued that substituting\\npre-existing taxes for environmental taxes has a positive impact that can (completely or partially) offset\\nthe negative impact of new taxation on labor market decisions. In addition, [7,8] has highlighted the\\nexistence of a new welfare effect, the benefit-side tax-interaction effect, which can magnify or reduce\\nthe benefits of the new taxation depending on what forms the benefits of a cleaner environment take.\\nIn a similar way, the model in this paper expands on the literature on the second-best environmental\\ntaxation of natural resources. In particular, it focuses on various measures for preserving the stock of\\nnatural resources by taking into account the market and non-market uses of environmental goods.\\nIn the model, market uses are reflected by the natural inputs used by firms, and the non-market uses of\\necosystem services capture the economic implications of both the use and non-use value of recreational\\nresources. The use value is modeled as the leisure that is directly connected with natural ecosystems.\\nThe non-use value is captured by the utility associated with the existence of natural resources.\\nThe conventional results of previous studies can be reinterpreted by considering the influence on\\nlabor-supply decisions of the (non-priced) services related to natural resources. By taking into account\\nthe use value of natural goods, correcting the environmental damages that affect natural resources has\\na positive effect on welfare and reduces the cost of implementing environmental instruments. In other\\nwords, if time spent by individuals on enjoying nature is taken into account, the negative impacts of\\nenvironmental measures are counterbalanced.\\nMoreover, the welfare impact of environmental regulations can depend on the type of measure\\napplied. Taxes on final consumption generate a higher first-best impact and a lower revenue recycling\\neffect than direct taxation on natural resources. Finally, the highest cost in terms of welfare is associated\\nwith a permits policy because it does not generate taxation revenues.\\nReal-world applications of the policy measures analyzed in this paper are required if these\\ntheoretical  results  are  to  be  tested  in  practice.   In  relation  to  empirical  assessments,  the  use  of\\na  single-country  perspective  could  limit  the  representation  of  the  (geographic)  interconnected\\nimpacts, whereas a multi-country perspective allows to capture the transmission mechanisms and the\\ninterrelations affecting natural resources. Despite the evaluations by [25–27], among others, clarifying\\nsome aspects of natural resources policies at the empirical level, further efforts should be made to gain\\nknowledge about the empirical consequences of natural resources management.\\nIn addition, the present paper opens up new areas for future research. As reported by Carbone\\nand Smith [21], individuals combine market goods and services with non-market environmental\\ngoods to compound the use of recreational services. Further research, beyond the scope of this paper,\\nwould consist of addressing these relationships in a general-equilibrium framework by capturing\\nthe links between the market (priced) and non-market (non-priced) components that are involved in\\nindividuals’ use of natural resources.\\nThe (static) representative household model used in this paper does not reflect the intergenerational\\nmechanisms nor the individual patterns inherent to the natural resource issues. Hence, future research\\nshould explore the utilization of overlapping generation models and heterogeneous agents to improve\\nthe  explanatory  ability  in  relation  to  natural  goods’  preservation  and  its  individual  dimension.\\nIn addition, the closed-economy perspective could be replaced by an open-economy model able to\\ncapture the potential benefits of terms of trade and foreign investment. This would open up the option\\nof analyzing financial linkages with the rest of the world and the consequent impacts on environmental\\nresources.   Research  on  natural  resources  needs  to  also  pay  attention  to  the  spatial  dimension,\\nsince environmental affectation is transmitted over space. In this respect, issues such as environmental\\ninteractions occurring in space, spatial patterns of resource usages, the impact of economic activities\\non some specific (spatially-allocated) natural goods, and environmental interregional spillovers have\\nto be taken into account explicitly when measures to preserve natural resources are analyzed.\\nFurthermore, given the present paper’s insights into the important effects of the different types\\nof policy, it would also be interesting to study the influence of the institutional characteristics of the\\n\\nSustainability2020,12, 156215 of 17\\nresources’ appropriation process on their preservation and on private welfare. From a practical point of\\nview, the ability to choose interventions to protect natural resources is very limited and depends on both\\nthe existence and the absence of market instruments. This suggests that institutions play a significant\\nrole, and this should explicitly be taken into account in the future research of environmental goods.\\nFunding:This  research  was  funded  by
