      "content": "Training of large language models (LLMs) on large scrapes of the web [Gem, Ope] has recently raised significant privacy concerns [Rahman and Santacana, 2023, Wu et al., 2023]. The inclusion of personally identifiable information (PII) and copyrighted material in the training corpora has led to legal challenges, notably the lawsuit between The New York Times and OpenAI [Gry, 2023], among others [Bak, 2023, Sil, 2023]. Such cases highlight the issue of using copyrighted content without attribution and/or license. Potentially, they undermine the rights of creators and disincentivize future artistic endeavors due to the lack of monetary compensation for works freely accessible online. This backdrop sets the stage for the technical challenge of identifying training data within machine learning models [Maini et al., 2021, Shokri et al., 2017]. Despite legal ambiguities, the task holds critical importance for understanding LLMs\u2019 operations and ensuring data accountability.",
