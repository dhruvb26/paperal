["Preprint\nArchitect\nBased on the requirements in PRD, the Architect agent devises technical specifications\nincluding system architecture diagrams and interface definitions. Initially, the Architect defines the\noverarching technical trajectory. Subsequently, the project\u2019s architecture, including files, classes\n(Figure 8) and the sequence flow chart (Figure 12), is designed. The Architect\u2019s documentation is\nthen given to the project manager for task allocation and execution.\nSystem design\n1\n## Implementation approach\n2\nWe will use Python\u2019s Tkinter library to create the GUI for the color meter. Tkinter is a standard\n,\u2192Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and is included with most Python installations. It\n,\u2192\nis simple to use and powerful enough for our needs.\n3\n4\nThe color selection functionality will be implemented using the PIL (Pillow) library, which allows\n,\u2192\nus to capture the screen\u2019s pixel data. By moving the mouse, we can get the RGB values of\n,\u2192\nthe pixel under the mouse cursor in real-time.\n5\n6\nThe RGB values will be displayed on the GUI using Tkinter\u2019s Label widget. We will use Python\u2019s\n,\u2192threading library to update the RGB values in real-time as the color meter moves.\n7\n8\nThe application will be tested for accuracy and performance using Python\u2019s unittest library.\n9\n10\n## Python package name\n11\n\u2018\u2018\u2018python\n12\n\"color_meter\"\n13\n\u2018\u2018\u2018\n14\n15\n## File list\n16\n\u2018\u2018\u2018python\n17\n[\n18\n\"main.py\",\n19\n\"color_picker.py\",\n20\n\"gui.py\",\n21\n\"tests.py\"\n22\n]\n23\n\u2018\u2018\u2018\n24\n25\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n26\nThe requirement is clear to me.\nFigure 8: Data structures and interface definitions for the \u201cDrawing App\u201d generated by the architect\nagent.\nProject Manager\nThe Project Manager breaks down the project into a task list.
