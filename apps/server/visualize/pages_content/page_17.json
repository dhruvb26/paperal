["Preprint\nProduct Requirement Document\n1\n2\n## Requirement Analysis\n3\nThe product should be a Python3 GUI application that serves as a color meter. It should allow\n,\u2192users to select any color on the screen and display the corresponding RGB values. The RGB\n,\u2192\nvalues should update in real-time as the color meter moves. The interface should be\n,\u2192simple and user-friendly.\n4\n5\n## Requirement Pool\n6\n\u2018\u2018\u2018python\n7\n[\n8\n(\"Design a user-friendly GUI for the color meter\", \"P0\"),\n9\n(\"Implement color selection functionality\", \"P0\"),\n10\n(\"Display RGB values of the selected color\", \"P0\"),\n11\n(\"Update RGB values in real-time as the color meter moves\", \"P0\"),\n12\n(\"Test the application for accuracy and performance\", \"P1\")\n13\n]\n14\n\u2018\u2018\u2018\n15\n16\n## UI Design draft\n17\nThe UI should be minimalistic and intuitive. It should primarily consist of a color meter, which\n,\u2192could be a magnified area of the screen that the user can move around. The RGB values of\n,\u2192the currently selected color should be prominently displayed, updating in real-time as\n,\u2192the color meter moves. The layout should be clean and uncluttered, with a focus on\n,\u2192functionality and ease of use.\n18\n19\n## Anything UNCLEAR\n20\nThere are no unclear points.\nFigure 7: The quadrant chart for the \u201cDrawing App\u201d generated by the product manager agent.\n18\n"]
