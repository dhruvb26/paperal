Preprint
Architect
Based on the requirements in PRD, the Architect agent devises technical specifications
including system architecture diagrams and interface definitions. Initially, the Architect defines the
overarching technical trajectory. Subsequently, the project’s architecture, including files, classes
(Figure 8) and the sequence flow chart (Figure 12), is designed. The Architect’s documentation is
then given to the project manager for task allocation and execution.
System design

## Implementation approach
2
We will use Python’s Tkinter library to create the GUI for the color meter. Tkinter is a standard
,→Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit and is included with most Python installations. It
,→
is simple to use and powerful enough for our needs.

4
The color selection functionality will be implemented using the PIL (Pillow) library, which allows
,→
us to capture the screen’s pixel data. By moving the mouse, we can get the RGB values of
,→
the pixel under the mouse cursor in real-time.

6
The RGB values will be displayed on the GUI using Tkinter’s Label widget. We will use Python’s
,→threading library to update the RGB values in real-time as the color meter moves.

8
The application will be tested for accuracy and performance using Python’s unittest library.

The requirement is clear to me.

Project Manager
The Project Manager breaks down the project into a task list. Furthermore, each
code file is analyzed based on its intended functionality and then treated as a separate task assigned
to Engineers.
