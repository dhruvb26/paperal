["Abstract\ns. These results consolidate the finding that no single\nMIA for LLMs works across all datasets, and we need to potentially find methods that adapt the choice\nof metric to the distribution. In Section 5, we will leverage a (selective) combination of different MIAs to\nimprove over the performance of any single MIA in order to perform successful LLM Dataset Inference.\nGuidelines for Future Research.\nBased on our observations in this section, we outline four important\npractices for future research in membership inference to enable sound experimentation and inferences. In\nparticular, (1) assessment for membership inference must be done in an IID setup where train and validation\nsplits are from the same distribution, (2) experiments must be repeated over multiple random splits of the\n6\n"]
