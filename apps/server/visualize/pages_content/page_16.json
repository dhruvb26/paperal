["Preprint\nB\nA DEMO OF THE EXECUTION\nIn this section, we outline the complete process of software development using MetaGPT. It begins\nwith a user\u2019s input command (as shown in Appendix B.1) and ends with software designed according\nto the user\u2019s specifications.\nB.1\nUSER INPUT\nUpon receiving an instruction from the user, MetaGPT collaborates with a professional development\nteam to fulfill the task. Here is a demo of user input:\nUser input\n1\nwrite a python3 GUI app such that you can draw an image with it\nB.2\nMETAGPT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS\nNow we provide a step-by-step explanation of the standardized output process for each agent.\nProduct Manager\nThe Product Manager generates a Product Requirement Document (PRD), as\ndetailed in the specified documentation. This document encompasses goals, user stories, competitive\nanalysis, requirement analysis and requirement pool. Additionally, a competitive quadrant chart is\nproduced (see Figure 7). Subsequently, these documents and charts are handed over to the architect\nfor system design.\nProduct Requirement Document\n1\n## Original Requirements\n2\nThe boss requires a Python3 GUI color meter that outputs the RGB values when it moves.\n3\n4\n## Product Goals\n5\n\u2018\u2018\u2018python\n6\n[\n7\n\"Create a user-friendly GUI color meter\",\n8\n\"Ensure the color meter accurately outputs RGB values\",\n9\n\"Ensure the color meter updates RGB values in real-time as it moves\"\n10\n]\n11\n\u2018\u2018\u2018\n12\n13\n## User Stories\n14\n\u2018\u2018\u2018python\n15\n[\n16\n\"As a user, I want to select any color on the screen, so that I can get its RGB values\",\n17\n\"As a user, I want the RGB values to update in real-time as I move the color meter, so that I\n,\u2192can get accurate color information\",\n18\n\"As a user, I want a simple and intuitive interface, so that I can easily use the color meter\"\n19\n]\n20\n\u2018\u2018\u2018\n21\n22\n## Competitive Analysis\n23\n\u2018\u2018\u2018python\n24\n[\n25\n\"Color Cop: A popular color picker for Windows.
