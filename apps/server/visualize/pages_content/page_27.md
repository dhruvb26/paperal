Excel data process
Write an excel data processing program based on streamlit and pandas. The
screen first shows an excel file upload button. After the excel file is uploaded,
use pandas to display its data content. The program is required to be concise,
easy to maintain, and not over-designed. It uses streamlit to process web
screen displays, and pandas is sufficient to process excel reading and display.
Please make sure others can execute directly without introducing additional
packages.

CRUD manage
Write a management program based on the crud addition, deletion, modifi-
cation and query processing of the customer business entity. The customer
needs to save this information: name, birthday, age, sex, and phone. The data
is stored in client.db, and there is a judgement whether the customer table ex-
ists. If it doesn’t, it needs to be created first. Querying is done by name; same
for deleting. The program is required to be concise, easy to maintain, and not
over-designed. The screen is realized through streamlit and sqlite—no need
to introduce other additional packages.
