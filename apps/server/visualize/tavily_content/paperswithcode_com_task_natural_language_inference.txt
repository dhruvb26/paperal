                Description with markdown (optional):
**Natural language inference (NLI)** is the task of determining whether a "hypothesis" is 
true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) given a "premise".
Example:
| Premise | Label | Hypothesis |
| --- | ---| --- |
| A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country. | contradiction | The man is sleeping. |
| An older and younger man smiling. | neutral  | Two men are smiling and laughing at the cats playing on the floor. |
| A soccer game with multiple males playing. | entailment | Some men are playing a sport. |
Approaches used for NLI include earlier symbolic and statistical approaches to more recent deep learning approaches. Benchmark datasets used for NLI include [SNLI](/dataset/snli), [MultiNLI](/dataset/multinli), [SciTail](/dataset/scitail), among others. You can get hands-on practice on the SNLI task by following this [d2l.ai chapter](https://d2l.ai/chapter_natural-language-processing-applications/natural-language-inference-and-dataset.html).

Natural language inference (NLI) is the task of determining whether a "hypothesis" is 
true (entailment), false (contradiction), or undetermined (neutral) given a "premise".
Example:
Premise
Label
Hypothesis
A man inspects the uniform of a figure in some East Asian country.
contradiction
The man is sleeping.
An older and younger man smiling.
neutral
Two men are smiling and laughing at the cats playing on the floor.
A soccer game with multiple males playing.
entailment
Some men are playing a sport.
Approaches used for NLI include earlier symbolic and statistical approaches to more recent deep learning approaches. Benchmark datasets used for NLI include SNLI, MultiNLI, SciTail, among others. You can get hands-on practice on the SNLI task by following this d2l.ai chapter.

We hypothesize that LMs perform ICL with irrelevant labels via two sequential processes: an inference function that solves the task, followed by a verbalization function that maps the inferred answer to the label space.
