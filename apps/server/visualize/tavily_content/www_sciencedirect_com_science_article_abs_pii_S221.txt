It is essential in several areas, such as healthcare and medical data protection. ML is applied to analyse medical records and disease forecasts. In our study, we review several ML algorithms, applications, techniques, opportunities, and challenges for the healthcare sector. This paper fills a research gap for efficient use of ML algorithms and applications in the healthcare sector.IntroductionMachine learning (ML) is an interdisciplinary field with roots in mathematics, statistics, knowledge analytics and data processing, which makes defining it challenging. ML is a specific type of artificial intelligence that gathers data from data for training. It has several branches and sub-branches at the tree's root, so we aren't telling the machines where to look in this learning process [1], [2]. ML is the analysis of techniques and algorithms for discovering patterns in data. These patterns can then be used to either improve our understanding of the current environment (e.g., by identifying infectious risk factors) or to forecast the future (e.g., forecast who will be infected) [3]. ML builds on ideas from optimization, statistics, and computer science. Practically all ML difficulties may be phrased as optimization problems with regard to a dataset. According to the diagram in Fig. 1, ML can be divided into four types. These include supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning [4]. Supervised learning is a subsection of ML in which machines learn from well-labelled data and predict the outcome. This suggests that input data already has the correct output. Semi-supervised learning uses a little amount of labelled data and a big amount of unlabelled data to train. Semi-supervised learning is between supervised and unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning uses AI algorithms to find patterns in data sets that are neither classified nor labelled. An agent can learn by “trial and error using feedback” from its own actions and practices, known as reinforcement learning [2], [4], [5]. During the forecast period of 2020 to 2027, the global healthcare AI market is predicted to develop at a CAGR of 41.4 percent, achieving $51.3 billion in value [6]. This review contributes to various machine learning applications, algorithms, techniques, opportunities, and challenges for healthcare during the emerging ML technological advancement to predict various critical and dangerous diseases.Section snippetsMachine learning applications in healthcareThe applications of ML in healthcare are growing, and it is benefiting patients and doctors alike in numerous ways. Automating healthcare billing, providing medical decision support, and creating medical care regulations are some of the highly popular healthcare applications for ML. There are numerous examples of ML and healthcare models being employed in medical [7], [8]. Medical imaging diagnostics, improved radiotherapy, personalised treatment, crowdsourced data gathering, smart healthML techniques in healthcareAlgorithms used in healthcare include deep learning, regression, ensemble, decision tree, and artificial neural network algorithms. “Convolutional neural networks (CNN), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression” are widely employed in healthcare sector [14], [15], [16]. Table 1 presents ML techniques and their applications in healthcare.Table 2 shows various algorithms to support healthcare data analysis. Sarwar and Sharma discussedOpportunities and challengesML allows us to connect existing data to future disease forecasts. Better predictions require innovative algorithms that maximise data information while using the best ML model. Continuous data inflow can help solve critical healthcare problems and improve clinical outcomes [45], [46]. These are just two major areas where ML can help make better decisions (advanced analytics and automation) and accurately detect anomalies (diagnosis and disease screening). Another is waste, fraud, abuse andConclusionMachine learning (ML) is essential in healthcare sector such as medical imaging diagnostics, improved radiotherapy, personalised treatment, crowdsourced data gathering, smart health records, ML-based behavioural modification, clinical trials, and research. Healthcare is becoming more problematic and costly. It uses several ML techniques to fix it. Various ML techniques and applications for disease prediction are presented in this paper. Using ML algorithms and techniques, we hope to improve the Declaration of Competing InterestThe authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.AcknowledgementsWe confirm that we did not require any type of funding from any organizations for this review.Recommended articlesReferences (48)M.Z.

ML algorithms can be trained using supervised learning, semi-supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning [27]. Advanced machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), decision tree, AdaBoost, Bagging and XGBoost, have been used to tackle different diseases, as shown in Fig. 9.Show abstractDeep learning and machine learning techniques present unmatched opportunities to improve healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). However, there is a paucity of literature on AI-based applications deployed to improve care in SSA, which makes it challenging to organise the research contributions in the present and to highlight obstacles and emerging research areas that need to be explored in the future. This study applied the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) model to conduct a comprehensive review of deep learning and machine learning models deployed in SSA to improve access to care while exploring emerging opportunities, trends and implications for integrating AI-based models in SSA healthcare. This study reveals that AI models can analyse and derive inferences from massive health data for early detection, diagnosis, monitoring for chronic disorders, prediction of diseases, monitoring large-scale public health patterns and help limit exposure in contagious environments. AI can facilitate the development of targeted health interventions and improve patient outcomes in all stages of diagnosis, treatment, drug development and monitoring, personalised medicine, patient control and care. Integrating AI models with health applications can tremendously assist health professionals and policymakers in disease diagnosis and making informed decisions. AI algorithms bias, poor access to health data and formats, and lack of policies and frameworks supporting the integration of data-driven AI-based solutions into health systems hinder the integration of AI-based models into health systems. There is a need for transparency and ethical use of AI and crafting policies that support the use of AI in SSA health systems. Utilising AI-based models in healthcare can also assist researchers and healthcare workers to move towards smart care and better comprehend future research needs of AI in smart care.Machine learning methods for schlieren imaging of a plasma channel in tenuous atomic vapor2023, Optics and Laser TechnologyCitation Excerpt :Rapid developments in computing and information science in recent years led to increasingly sophisticated Machine Learning (ML) implementations. The list of possible applications is ever growing, including (but not limited to) autonomous driving [1], healthcare [2], speech recognition [3] and various high-energy physics studies [4,5]. Machine learning methods have been used for some time also for evaluating optical diagnostic measurements in plasma physics, for example, tomographic measurements of radiation from fusion plasmas [6–9].Show abstractWe investigate the usage of a schlieren imaging setup to measure the geometrical dimensions of a plasma channel in atomic vapor. Near resonant probe light is used to image the plasma channel in the tenuous vapor and machine learning techniques are tested for extracting quantitative information from the images. We build a database of simulated signals with a range of plasma parameters for training Deep Neural Networks, and demonstrate that they can estimate, from the schlieren images, reliably and with high accuracy the location, the radius and the maximum ionization fraction of the plasma channel as well as the width of the transition region between the core of the plasma channel and the unionized vapor. We test several different neural network architectures with supervised learning and show that the parameter estimations supplied by the networks are resilient with respect to slight changes of the experimental parameters that may occur in the course of a measurement.Machine learning and deep learning-based approach in smart healthcare: Recent advances, applications, challenges and opportunities2024, AIMS Public HealthEffective Feature Engineering and Classification of Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A Comparative Study2023, BioMedInformaticsGuidelines and Standard Frameworks for AI in Medicine: Protocol for a Systematic Literature Review2023, JMIR Research ProtocolsDevelopment and Integration of Metocean Data Interoperability for Intelligent Operations and Automation Using Machine Learning: A Review2022, Applied Sciences (Switzerland)View all citing articles on ScopusView full text© 2021 Elsevier Ltd.
