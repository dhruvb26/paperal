INTRODUCTION Machine Learning (ML) and the field of medical care are fundamentally  two  separate  realms.  However,  in  recent times,  developments  in  the  field  of  Artificial  Intelligence (AI),  particularly  in  ML,  have  opened  up  intriguing  new opportunities  in  medical  treatment  [1].  The  dynamic intersection between ML and the domain of medical care has captured  the  attention  of  researchers  and  healthcare practitioners alike, and has also triggered a paradigm shift in the  approach towards  medical treatment  [2], [3].  ML,  as a component  of  AI,  encompasses  algorithms  that  enable computers  to  learn  patterns  from  data,  adapt,  and  make predictions or  decisions without  explicit programming [4]–[6]. ML has rapidly evolved from a theoretical concept into a tangible force that holds the promise of revolutionizing how diseases are diagnosed, treated, and managed [7]–[9]. The integration of ML into medical practices is a response to  the  skyrocketing  challenges  faced  by  the  healthcare industry.  As  medical  data  explodes  in  volume  and complexity, traditional approaches to diagnosis and treatment are  being  put  to  the  test.  The  effectiveness  of  medical decisions relies on assimilating and interpreting a wide range of patient data, including medical histories, medical imaging results, genomic  information, and clinical  records. ML has the  potential  to  sift  through  these  intricate  data  patterns, unveil hidden correlations, and extract insights that can guide more  accurate diagnoses  and tailored  treatment  plans  [10], [11]. The crux  of this  topic lies  not only  in its  technological implementation  but  also  in  its  profound  human  potential. Successful  integration  of  ML  into  medical  care  can  yield faster  diagnoses,  reduce  medical  errors,  and  optimize resource  allocation.  This  is  crucial  in  addressing  the increasing demand for high-quality healthcare services while contending with resource limitations and time constraints. This  review  article  aims  to  elucidate  the  intricate relationship between  ML  and medical treatment by  delving into the mechanisms through which  ML algorithms operate in  a medical  context. It  also endeavors  to  explore  various fields within medical care where ML techniques have shown promising results through systematic examination of existing literature,  case  studies, and  ongoing  research  projects. The article also highlights examples where ML has demonstrated transformative  potential  in  disease  diagnosis  [12]–[15], prognosis [16]–[18], personalized treatment [19]–[21], drug discovery  [22],  [23],  and  patient  management  [24],  [25], Furthermore, the article seeks to provide an in-depth analysis of the challenges  that  invariably accompany the  integration of ML into medical treatment. These challenges encompass a range  of  issues,  from  data  privacy  concerns  and  ethical considerations  to  technical  barriers  and  the  need  for interpretable  models.  From  these  issues,  this  article  also attempts  to  discuss  potential solutions  or steps  that  can be taken to address the existing problems [26]–[28].  Therefore, the discussions in this article are expected to encourage the advancement of medical practices through the integration of AI and wise human values. 
Journal of Robotics and Control (JRC)  ISSN: 2715-5072  622  Furizal, Application of Machine Learning in Healthcare and Medicine: A Review II. FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF ML IN MEDICAL TREATMENT A. Introduction to ML in Medical Treatment ML  is  a  branch  of  artificial  intelligence  that  teaches computers to  learn  from data and  make decisions  based on patterns  found  in  that  data.  In  the  context  of  medical treatment,  ML  enables  computers  to  process medical  data, identify  health  patterns,  and  make predictions  without  the need for explicit programming. The  fundamental  concept  behind  ML  involves  several components such as models, training, and evaluation [29]. A model is  a  mathematical representation  of the  relationships between variables in the data. This model can take the form of  mathematical  functions  or  structures  that  depict  how variables influence each other. The primary goal of creating a  model  is  to  enable  the  computer  to  recognize  hidden patterns  or  rules  within  the  data.  A  good  model  will  be capable of accurately representing the relationships between variables. The training process is at the core of ML. During training, the model is  provided with  knowledge and is  trained  using data to identify patterns and make accurate predictions. Once the model is trained, the next step is to measure how well the model  performs  on  unseen  data  (test  or  validation  data). Evaluation aims to understand to what extent the model can generalize  the  patterns  learned  during  training.  Common evaluation metrics include accuracy [30], [31], precision and recall [32]–[34], F1-score [35]–[37], confusion  matrix [38], ROC, Mean Absolute Error  (MAE)  [39], and others. These metrics  help  gauge  the  model's  ability  to  make  correct predictions  and  avoid  errors  that  could  have  serious implications in medical treatment. These three fundamental concepts work together to create an effective model that understands medical data and makes accurate  predictions.  It's  important  to  remember  that  the quality  of  training  data  significantly  impacts  the  model's performance. Models  trained with high-quality  data tend to have better capabilities in recognizing patterns and providing more accurate prediction outcomes. The application of ML in the medical field is illustrated in Fig. 1. B. Categories of ML Algorithms ML  algorithms  can  be  categorized  into  several groups based on the type of learning they utilize, namely Supervised Learning  (SL),  Unsupervised  Learning  (UL),  and Reinforcement Learning (RL) [40]. SL is a type of ML that trains  models  using  data  containing  patient  examples  and corresponding  labels,  such  as  diagnoses  or  treatment outcomes.  Popular  algorithms  in  this  category  include Random Forest (RF) [41], Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks. UL  is  a  type  of  ML  that  trains  models  by  identifying patterns in unlabeled data. It is suitable for grouping patients into  specific  categories  based  on  shared  characteristics. Popular  algorithms  in  this  category  include  K-Means Clustering  and Hierarchical  Clustering. On  the  other hand, RL  is  a  ML  approach  in  which  algorithms  learn  through repeated interactions with their environment. RL algorithms, often  referred  to  as  "agents,"  learn  to  take  actions  that optimize a goal, such as maximizing rewards provided by the environment. Agents receive feedback in the form of rewards or punishments after each action taken, and their objective is to learn the best decisions based on this feedback. RL is often used in applications like robot control, computer games, and resource  optimization.  While  RL  is  less  commonly  used directly in  medical treatment, its  concept can  be applied in the development of optimal treatment planning algorithms. A comparison illustration of SL, UL, and RL is shown in Fig. 2.  In addition to the core categories mentioned above, there are  several  other  specialized categories  of ML  algorithms. These  include  semi-supervised  learning  [63],  [64],  where algorithms leverage both labeled and unlabeled data; transfer learning,  which  involves  reusing a  pre-trained  model  for  a related  task;  deep  learning  [65]–[68],  utilizing  neural networks  with  multiple  layers  for  complex  pattern recognition;  ensemble  learning  [69]–[71],  combining multiple  models  to  improve  predictive  accuracy;  anomaly detection [72], [73], identifying  rare or abnormal instances; NLP  algorithms  [74],  enabling  machines  to  understand human language; and time series forecasting algorithms [75], [76],  predicting  future  values  based  on  historical  data patterns.

Illustration of the comparison of working concepts of SL, UL, and RL in the medical field III. ML IN DISEASE PREDICTION AND TREATMENT A. Disease Progression Prediction Predicting  disease  progression  is  one  field  where  ML plays a crucial role. ML algorithms can analyze and identify patterns related to disease progression by leveraging patient data such as medical history, symptoms, laboratory tests, and medical  images. A  concrete  example  is the  use  of  ML  to predict the risk of diabetes in patients by analyzing data like blood glucose  levels, body  mass  index, and  family history. ML  can identify  significant risk  factors  and  provide  more accurate predictions of diabetes risk compared to traditional methods.  Thus,  the  use  of  ML  in  predicting  disease progression  offers  the  advantage  of  guiding  early interventions and preventing more severe complications. B. Personalization of Treatment and Therapy Personalized treatment and therapy are crucial aspects of modern  medical  care  [77].  Each  patient  possesses  unique characteristics that influence  their response to  treatment. In this regard, ML can play a significant role in assisting doctors to  design  tailored  treatment  plans  according  to  individual needs.  For  instance,  in  cancer  treatment,  ML  can analyze patients' genetic data and responses to  previous therapies to predict  the  most  likely successful  treatment. This  avoids  a one-size-fits-all  approach  and  ensures  that  each  patient receives the most appropriate care for their condition. IV. LITERATURE STUDY OF ML APPLICATION IN MEDICINE Effective  healthcare  data  management  is  crucial  for providing  quality  healthcare  services  and  conducting meaningful research.  ML  plays a pivotal role  in processing and  comprehending  large  volumes  of  health  data,  often referred to as “big data”. ML algorithms can identify patterns, trends, and relationships within extensive datasets that might be overlooked by human analysis [78]–[80]. This empowers healthcare  providers  and  researchers  to  extract  valuable insights,  such  as  identifying  risk  factors,  tracking  disease progression,  and  evaluating  treatment  outcomes.  ML techniques  like  clustering  and  classification  enable  the organization  and categorization  of patient  data,  facilitating more accurate  diagnoses  and tailored  treatment plans  [81]–[83]. In the realm of medical diagnostics, ML has facilitated the development  of  automated  systems  capable  of  diagnosing diseases through the analysis of medical images like MRI and CT  scans  [84], [85].  ML's  impact  extends to  personalized care, enabling a more individualized approach by leveraging patient  data  and  clinical  histories  to  develop  predictive models  that  respond  specifically  to  each  patient's  needs. Consequently,  ML  leads  to  more  efficient  and  effective treatments. The field of genomics is also influenced by ML, with its ability to analyze complex genomic data to identify genetic  patterns  associated  with  diseases  or  responses  to medications, driving the development of targeted and precise treatments. On  the  research  front,  ML aids  in analyzing  data  from large-scale  clinical  studies  more  swiftly  and  accurately, enabling the identification of trends, risk factors, and therapy responses.  Particularly,  ML-based  patient  monitoring algorithms can detect subtle changes in patient data in real-time, assisting medical teams in responding to conditions that require immediate action. Through NLP, ML also enables the analysis of unstructured clinical data, such as medical records and  radiology  reports,  to  support  better  clinical  decision-making [86]–[88]. In  the  pursuit  of  new  drug  discovery,  ML  assists  in predicting  drug  potential based  on molecular  structure  and biological  interactions,  expediting  the  drug  discovery  and 
Journal of Robotics and Control (JRC)  ISSN: 2715-5072  624  Furizal, Application of Machine Learning in Healthcare and Medicine: A Review development process  [89], [90]. However,  certain literature also raises ethical and security concerns related to the use of ML  in  medical  contexts,  including  patient  data  privacy considerations,  ML  model  interpretation,  and  the  ethical implications  of  integrating  medical  decision-making  with algorithms.  Several literature  studies on  the  application  of ML  in  the  medical  field are  presented in  Table  I.  Table  I represents a collection of research studies evaluating the use of ML techniques in various medical contexts, ranging from disease diagnosis to cancer detection. Each row in  the table represents a specific research study and includes information about the identified disease, types of data used, data sources, applied ML algorithms, evaluation methods, achieved results, and the year of the study. Through the compilation of research studies presented in the table, a profound conclusion can be drawn regarding the role  and  impact of  ML  in  the medical  field. These  studies have provided crucial insights into how ML can be employed for  disease  diagnosis, medical  condition classification,  and enhancement  of  clinical decision-making.  Upon comparing these studies, certain  findings and patterns  stand out, while challenges and opportunities become evident. From  the  perspective  of  disease diagnosis,  studies [42] and [43] focusing on leukemia (ALL) demonstrate that ML can address the  complexity of medical  data  analysis with a relatively high accuracy, namely 95.6% and 93.84%. The use of  SVM  and  other  algorithms  in  analyzing  data  patterns enables  the  identification  of  disease  symptoms  with consistent  outcomes.  A  similar  trend  can  be  observed  in studies [44], [45], [48], where the application of SVM, k-NN, RF, LR, and CNN algorithms showcases the capability of ML in classifying  various diseases,  spanning  from white  blood cells  to  cardiac  arrhythmias  and  brain  and  breast  tumors, achieving accuracy rates ranging from 80.8% to 92.8%. When  involving  medical  videos,  study  [46]  has demonstrated  that  ML  can  yield  high-accuracy  results  in identifying  colorectal cancer  with  an  accuracy  of 90.28%. This  outcome  highlights  ML's  significant  potential  as  a valuable  tool  in  accurately  interpreting  and  classifying medical videos. Similarly, when dealing with medical images [48],  [50],  [51],  [55],  [56],  [61],  ML  has  also  proven  to deliver commendable outcomes with accuracies ranging from 83.64% to 99.86%. V. CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS IN ADOPTING ML IN MEDICINE A. Data Quality and Quantity The primary challenge in adopting ML techniques in the medical field is the complexity and variability of medical data generated  from various  sources and healthcare  information systems.  Medical  data  is  often  distributed  across  diverse formats, including clinical records, medical images, genomic data,  and  more  [91],  [92].  This  challenge  encompasses difficulties in integrating and processing data with different structures,  formats,  and  languages  [93].  Additionally, medical  data is  susceptible  to  noise,  recording errors,  and variations in interpretation by healthcare practitioners, which can  impact  the  quality  and  accuracy  of  the  resulting  ML models.  Limited  and fragmented  data availability  can also affect the  model's ability  to generate generalized  and valid predictions across various medical scenarios. To address these challenges, a holistic approach involving improved  medical  data  integration  and  data  quality enhancement is necessary.  Firstly, standardizing  the format and structure of medical data can help address data diversity. The  use  of  standards  such  as  Health  Level  Seven International  (HL7)  for  data  exchange  and  formats  like Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) for image-based medical data can reduce integration barriers [94]–[98].  Additionally,  technologies  like  NLP  can  be employed  to  handle  unstructured  data,  such  as  medical records  or  radiology  reports,  transforming  them  into information that  can be  processed by  ML  algorithms [99]–[101]. This approach can be bolstered by the implementation of  integrated,  cloud-based  data  management  systems, enabling efficient access and exchange of medical data across healthcare  institutions.  With  these  solutions  in  place,  the main challenges in harnessing ML for medical purposes can be  overcome,  unlocking  the  significant potential  of ML  in healthcare treatment and diagnostics. B. Data Privacy and Security The challenge of ensuring data privacy and security is a critical  concern  when  implementing  ML  in  the  medical domain.  Medical  data  contains  sensitive  and  confidential information about patients, including their health conditions, treatment histories, and personal identifiers [102]–[105]. As ML techniques  involve processing  and analyzing this  data, there  is  a  risk  of  unauthorized  access,  data  breaches,  and potential  misuse  of  patient  information.  Moreover,  the increasing adoption of cloud-based solutions for data storage and  processing  introduces  additional  complexities  in safeguarding  data  against  potential  cyber  threats  and vulnerabilities. To  address the  challenge  of  data  privacy  and  security, stringent  measures  must  be  put  in  place.  Firstly,  robust encryption  techniques  should  be  employed  to  secure  data both  at  rest  and  during  transmission.  This  helps  protect patient  information  from  being  accessed  by  unauthorized parties. Secondly, the implementation of access controls and authentication  mechanisms  ensures  that  only  authorized personnel  can  access  sensitive  medical  data.  Regular monitoring and auditing of data access can help identify any unusual activities promptly. Additionally, anonymization and de-identification  techniques  can  be  applied  to  remove personally  identifiable  information  from  datasets  used  for ML training, reducing the risk of re-identification. Collaboration  with  cybersecurity experts and  adherence to  established  industry  standards,  such  as  the  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United  States  [106]–[108]  or  the  General  Data  Protection Regulation  (GDPR)  in  Europe  [109],  [110],  can  provide guidelines and  best practices  for ensuring  data privacy  and security in the context of ML in healthcare. By adopting these measures, healthcare organizations can maintain patient trust and ensure that data remains protected while benefiting from the advancements brought by ML technologies.

Journal of Robotics and Control (JRC)  ISSN: 2715-5072  626  Furizal, Application of Machine Learning in Healthcare and Medicine: A Review C. Misinterpretation Misinterpretation of ML results is a significant challenge in the medical  field,  which can have  profound  implications for  patient  care  and  decision-making.  ML  models  often operate  as  complex  "black-boxes,"  making  it  difficult  to understand  the  underlying  factors  that  contribute  to  their predictions.  This  lack  of  interpretability  can  lead  to difficulties  in  validating the  reliability and  accuracy of  the model's  outputs,  especially  in  critical  medical  scenarios. Misinterpretation  can  occur  when  healthcare  professionals either overly rely on ML predictions without understanding their  limitations  or  misjudge  the  confidence  level  of  a prediction,  potentially  leading  to  incorrect  diagnoses  or treatment plans. To  mitigate  the  challenge  of  misinterpretation,  several strategies can be employed. Firstly, developing interpretable ML  models  is  essential.  Techniques  such  as  feature importance  analysis,  SHAP  (SHapley  Additive exPlanations),  and  LIME  (Local  Interpretable  Model-agnostic  Explanations)  can  shed  light  on  how  the  model arrived  at a  particular  prediction  by  highlighting the  most influential  features  [111],  [112].  Secondly,  providing clinicians and  medical practitioners  with  proper training in understanding  and  interpreting  ML  results  is  crucial. Healthcare professionals should be aware of the strengths and limitations  of  the  models  they  are  using  and  should  be encouraged to critically assess the predictions in the context of their clinical expertise. Collaborative efforts between data scientists, clinicians, and domain experts can bridge the gap between  technical  understanding  and  medical  practice, ensuring that ML results are used effectively and responsibly. Furthermore,  transparency  in  model  development  and reporting,  including  documentation  of  the  dataset  used, preprocessing  steps,  and  model  architecture,  can  enhance accountability  and  facilitate  peer  review,  aiding  in  the accurate  interpretation  of  results.  By  addressing misinterpretation challenges through a combination of model interpretability,  education,  and  collaboration,  the  medical community can harness the power of ML while maintaining the highest standards of patient care and safety. D. Clinical Acceptance The  main  challenge in  achieving clinical  acceptance of ML technology in the medical field is to build confidence and trust among healthcare professionals in the effectiveness and reliability  of  ML  models  [113].  Medical  practitioners typically rely on established practices and scientific evidence, and  integrating  new  technologies  like  ML  can  trigger uncertainty and  resistance. Overcoming  concerns related  to accuracy [114], clinical validity, and the risk of errors arising from the interpretation or recommendations of ML models is crucial. One  key  solution  is  close  collaboration  between  data scientists,  medical  practitioners,  and  domain  experts. Ensuring  that  ML  models  are  based  on  relevant  and representative  data and  applied in  the  appropriate  medical context is a vital step in building clinical acceptance. Model development  also  needs  to  consider  the  understanding  of medical  practitioners  about  the  algorithms  and  evaluation metrics  used.  Additionally,  it's  important  to  prioritize  a transparent  and  interpretable  approach  in  ML  decision-making,  so  that  medical practitioners  can comprehend  and feel  confident  in  the  outcomes  and  recommendations provided by the model. Proper education and training are also necessary  to  help  healthcare  professionals  understand  the added value offered by ML technology and how to integrate it  safely  and  effectively  into  their  daily  clinical  practice. Therefore,  a  collaborative  and  comprehensive  approach involving  medical  and  technological  stakeholders  will contribute to broader clinical acceptance of ML technology in the medical field. E. Interoperability Interoperability stands as a critical challenge in adopting ML  technology  in  the  medical  field.  Health  data  is  often scattered  across  various  systems,  platforms,  and  different formats,  making  integration  and  exchange  of  data  among healthcare entities challenging. The inability of systems and applications  to  communicate  seamlessly  can  hinder  ML's ability  to  harness  comprehensive  information  from  diverse data  sources.  This  situation  often  leads to  inefficiencies in data  management  and  reduces  the  effectiveness  of  more holistic and accurate analyses. To address interoperability challenges, a crucial step is to develop  standardized  data  and  exchange  protocols  that  are uniform across  the healthcare  industry. Adopting  standards like Fast  Healthcare Interoperability  Resources (FHIR)  can enable  consistent  data  exchange that  can be  interpreted  by various  systems  [115]–[117].  Furthermore,  leveraging Application  Programming  Interfaces  (APIs)  can  facilitate communication  and  data  integration  across  different platforms [118], [119]. Thus, collaboration  and  information exchange  among  healthcare  institutions  can  be  enhanced, supporting  the effective  and  comprehensive  application  of ML in health data analysis. F. Resource Constraints Resource constraints  pose a  significant challenge  in the adoption  of  ML  in  the  medical  domain.  ML  algorithms require  substantial  computational  power  and  memory, especially for processing  and analyzing large-scale  medical datasets. Many healthcare facilities face limitations in terms of  available  hardware,  software,  and  technical  expertise, hindering  the  seamless  implementation  of  ML  solutions. These  constraints  can  hinder  the  timely  and  efficient deployment  of  ML  models,  delaying  the  potential  benefits they could bring to medical decision-making and patient care. To  address  resource  constraints,  a  combination  of strategies  can  be  employed.  Cloud  computing  offers  a solution  by  providing  scalable  and  flexible  resources  on-demand,  reducing  the  burden  on  local  hardware infrastructure.  Healthcare  institutions  can  leverage  cloud platforms  to  access  powerful  computational  resources without  investing  heavily  in  physical  hardware. Collaborating  with  technology  partners  or  vendors specializing  in  healthcare-oriented  ML  solutions  can  also mitigate  resource  challenges  [120].  Such  partnerships  can provide healthcare professionals with access to cutting-edge algorithms  and  expertise,  allowing  them  to  focus  on  the medical  aspects rather  than the  technical complexities.  By strategically  utilizing  cloud  resources  and  engaging  with 
Journal of Robotics and Control (JRC)  ISSN: 2715-5072  627  Furizal, Application of Machine Learning in Healthcare and Medicine: A Review external  expertise,  healthcare  facilities  can  overcome resource limitations  and  effectively harness the potential  of ML for medical advancements. G. Medical Ethics The  integration  of  ML  in  the  medical  field  introduces complex ethical challenges. One of the main concerns is the potential impact on patient privacy and confidentiality [121]–[123]. ML algorithms often require access to sensitive patient data, raising questions about data security, informed consent, and  the  risk  of  unauthorized  access  or  breaches.  Another challenge  involves  the  transparency  of  ML  algorithms' decision-making processes. Addressing  these  challenges  requires  a  multi-faceted approach. To  ensure patient privacy, robust data  protection measures  should  be  implemented,  such  as  data anonymization and encryption. Healthcare institutions should also  prioritize  obtaining  informed  consent  from  patients before  their  data  is  used  for  ML  purposes,  fostering transparency and respect for patient autonomy. Additionally, the development of interpretable and explainable ML models can  enhance  their  ethical  standing. By  implementing these solutions,  the  ethical  challenges  associated  with  medical applications of ML can be effectively addressed, promoting responsible  and  patient-centered deployment  of technology in healthcare. All the challenges and solutions in implementing ML in healthcare and medicine in this article have been summarized in Fig. 3. VI. CONCLUSSION In conclusion, the comprehensive analysis of literature in the  application  of  ML  within the  realm  of  healthcare  and medicine  reveals  its  remarkable  potential  and  significant challenges.  The  studies  discussed,  particularly  those involving disease diagnosis and medical image interpretation, underscore  the  substantial  accuracy  achieved  by  ML algorithms, with some even surpassing 90%. Notably, CNNs and  other  techniques  like  SVM,  RF,  k-NN,  and  DT  play pivotal  roles  in  achieving  these  impressive  results.  This demonstrates  ML's  transformative  impact  on  medical practices,  from  enhancing  disease  detection  to  enabling precise medical image analysis. However, challenges persist, notably in ensuring data quality, managing complex datasets, and  addressing  variations  that  affect  ML  algorithm effectiveness.  These  obstacles  underline  the  necessity  of ongoing research and collaboration among multidisciplinary stakeholders, including medical professionals, data scientists, and  technologists.  Overcoming  challenges  requires standardized  data  formats,  robust  encryption  for  privacy, interpretability  to  build  trust,  comprehensive  clinician training, and enhanced collaboration among stakeholders.

Precision prevention implements highly precise, tailored health interventions for individuals by directly addressing personal and environmental determinants of health. However, precision prevention does not yet appear to be fully established in occupational health. There are numerous understandings and conceptual approaches, but these have not yet been systematically presented or synthesized. Therefore, this conceptual analysis aims to propose a unified understanding and develop an integrative conceptual framework for precision prevention in occupational health.
Methods
Firstly, to systematically present definitions and frameworks of precision prevention in occupational health, six international databases were searched for studies published between January 2010 and January 2024 that used the term precision prevention or its synonyms in the context of occupational health. Secondly, a qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the existing definitions and propose a unified understanding. Thirdly, based on the identified frameworks, a multi-stage exploratory development process was applied to develop and propose an integrative conceptual framework for precision prevention in occupational health.
Results
After screening 3,681 articles, 154 publications were reviewed, wherein 29 definitions of precision prevention and 64 different frameworks were found, which can be summarized in eight higher-order categories. The qualitative content analysis revealed seven themes and illustrated many different wordings. The proposed unified understanding of precision prevention in occupational health takes up the identified themes. It includes, among other things, a contrast to a “one-size-fits-all approach” with a risk- and resource-oriented data collection and innovative data analytics with profiling to provide and improve tailored interventions. The developed and proposed integrative conceptual framework comprises three overarching stages: (1) data generation, (2) data management lifecycle and (3) interventions (development, implementation and adaptation).
Discussion
Although there are already numerous studies on precision prevention in occupational health, this conceptual analysis offers, for the first time, a proposal for a unified understanding and an integrative conceptual framework. However, the proposed unified understanding and the developed integrative conceptual framework should only be seen as an initial proposal that should be critically discussed and further developed to expand and strengthen both research on precision prevention in occupational health and its practical application in the workplace.ViewShow abstract...

image segmentation that had been optimized with SGD. The data used is
BraTS2020O which contains a collection of MRI data. This optimization
aims to improve the performance of the U-net architecture for segmenting
brain tumor images. The results of the study show that the SGD
optimization carried out has succeeded in providing better performance
than previous studies. This can be seen from the performance value
obtained at 0.9879. This accuracy value indicates an increase in accuracy
from previous studies. High accuracy indicates that the SGD-optimized
model has good segmentation prediction performanceViewShow abstractDeep Learning Model Implementation Using Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm for Default P2P Lending PredictionArticleFull-text availableSep 2023 Tiara Lailatul Nikmah Jumanto Unjung Budi Prasetiyo Much Aziz MuslimPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending is one of the innovations in the field of fintech that offers microloan services through online channels without intermediaries. P2P lending facilitates the lending and borrowing process between borrowers and lenders, but on the other hand, there is a threat that can harm lenders, namely default. Defaults on P2P lending platforms result in significant losses for lenders and pose a threat to the overall efficiency of the peer-to-peer lending system. So, it is essential to have an understanding of such risk management methods. However, designing feature extractors with very complicated information about borrowers and loan products takes a lot of work. In this study, we present a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for predicting default in P2P lending, with the goal of extracting features automatically and improving performance. CNN is a deep learning technique for classifying complex information that automatically extracts discriminative features from input data using convolutional operations. The dataset used is the Lending Club dataset from P2P lending platforms in America containing 9,578 data. The results of the model performance evaluation got an accuracy of 85.43%. This study shows reasonably decent results in predicting p2p lending based on CNN. This research is expected to contribute to the development of new methods of deep learning that are more complex and effective in predicting risks on P2P lending platforms.ViewShow abstractBeyond Visual Interpretation: Quantitative Analysis and Artificial Intelligence in Interstitial Lung Disease Diagnosis "Expanding Horizons in Radiology"ArticleFull-text availableJul 2023 Gaetano ReaNicola Sverzellati Marialuisa Bocchino Giacomo SicaDiffuse lung disorders (DLDs) and interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are pathological conditions affecting the lung parenchyma and interstitial network. There are approximately 200 different entities within this category. Radiologists play an increasingly important role in diagnosing and monitoring ILDs, as they can provide non-invasive, rapid, and repeatable assessments using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). HRCT offers a detailed view of the lung parenchyma, resembling a low-magnification anatomical preparation from a histological perspective. The intrinsic contrast provided by air in HRCT enables the identification of even the subtlest morphological changes in the lung tissue. By interpreting the findings observed on HRCT, radiologists can make a differential diagnosis and provide a pattern diagnosis in collaboration with the clinical and functional data. The use of quantitative software and artificial intelligence (AI) further enhances the analysis of ILDs, providing an objective and comprehensive evaluation. The integration of "meta-data" such as demographics, laboratory, genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data through AI could lead to a more comprehensive clinical and instrumental profiling beyond the human eye's capabilities.ViewShow abstractReal-time Algorithmic Exchange and Processing of Pharmaceutical Quality Data and InformationArticleAug 2023INT J PHARMACEUTAnderson Craig Rita AlgorriJ. Abernathy MichaelHerein, a modern method is proposed for exchanging and processing real-time medicinal product information using Health Level 7 International's (HL7) Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR®) standard, Application Programming Interfaces (API), digitization and artificial intelligence. FHIR is presently in use largely to facilitate interactions between patient-facing healthcare institutions, such as hospitals, doctor's offices, and laboratories, for electronic health record management and exchange. There are several ongoing efforts to adapt the FHIR standard for regulatory use cases to support the needs of the global biopharmaceutical industry, including the exchange of Electronic Product Information (ePI); chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) data; and adverse event reporting. Once in place, this new method of data exchange is expected to (1) improve efficiency by reducing the time and effort needed to manage regulatory information; (2) accelerate decision making; (3) encourage innovation in pharmaceutical manufacturing; (4) improve the ability and agility of information exchange. Currently, the end-to-end timescale for the pharmaceutical regulatory workflow is measured in months and years. This new paradigm will use FHIR APIs and other supporting technologies to reduce the potential time for data exchange from months to days, hours, minutes, and eventually sub-seconds. With such drastic improvements in speed provided by digitization, automation, and interoperability, the biopharmaceutical industry can reach more patients, and more quickly than at any time in the industry's 100+ year history. The present work will focus on examining specific real-world implementation examples for using FHIR to support exchange of CMC information within and across the biopharmaceutical industry.ViewShow abstractThe Applications of Machine Learning Techniques in Medical Data Processing based on Distributed Computing and the Internet of ThingsArticleAug 2023COMPUT METH PROG BIO Sarina Aminizadeh Arash HeidariShiva ToumajMehmet UnalMedical data processing has grown into a prominent topic in the latest decades with the primary goal of maintaining patient data via new information technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor technologies, which generate patient indexes in hospital data networks. Innovations like distributed computing, Machine Learning (ML), blockchain, chatbots, wearables, and pattern recognition can adequately enable the collection and processing of medical data for decision-making in the healthcare era. Particularly, to assist experts in the disease diagnostic process, distributed computing is beneficial by digesting huge volumes of data swiftly and producing personalized smart suggestions. On the other side, the current globe is confronting an outbreak of COVID-19, so an early diagnosis technique is crucial to lowering the fatality rate. ML systems are beneficial in aiding radiologists in examining the incredible amount of medical images. Nevertheless, they demand a huge quantity of training data that must be unified for processing. Hence, developing Deep Learning (DL) confronts multiple issues, such as conventional data collection, quality assurance, knowledge exchange, privacy preservation, administrative laws, and ethical considerations. In this research, we intend to convey an inclusive analysis of the most recent studies in applications of distributed computing platforms based on five categorized platforms, including cloud computing, edge, fog, IoT, and hybrid platforms. So, we evaluated 27 articles regarding the usage of the proposed framework, deployed methods, and applications, noting the advantages, drawbacks, and the applied dataset and screening the security mechanism and the presence of the Transfer Learning (TL) method. As a result, it was proved that most of the recent research (about 43%) used the IoT platform as the environment for the proposed architecture, and most of the studies (about 46%) were done in 2021. In addition, the most popular utilized DL algorithm was the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), with a percentage of 19.4%. Hence, despite how technology changes, delivering appropriate therapy for patients is the primary aim of healthcare-associated departments. Therefore, further studies are recommended for developing more functional architectures based on DL and distributed environments and better evaluation of the present healthcare data analysis models.ViewShow abstractCardiovascular Health Management Compliance with Health Insurance Portability and Accountability ActConference PaperJun 2023 Masrura TasnimArleen Joy Patinga Hossain Shahriar Sweta SnehaViewOpportunities and challenges for biomarker discovery using electronic health record dataArticleJul 2023TRENDS MOL MEDP.
