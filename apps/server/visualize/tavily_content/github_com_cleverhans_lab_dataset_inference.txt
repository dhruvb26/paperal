Repository for the paper Dataset Inference: Ownership Resolution in Machine Learning by Pratyush Maini, Mohammad Yaghini and Nicolas Papernot. This work was presented at ICLR 2021 as a Spotlight Presentation.
What does this repository contain?
Code for training and evaluating all the experiments that support the aforementioned paper are provided in this repository.
The instructions for reproducing the results can be found below.
Dependencies
The repository is written using python 3.8. To install dependencies run the command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Resolving Ownership
If you already have the extracted featured for the victim and potentially stolen models, you can proceed to inferring potential theft. A sample jupyter notebook to perform the same can be found at:
src/notebooks/CIFAR10_rand.ipynb
You can download extracted features for our models from this link. Save them in a directory names files in the root directory.
Training your own models
python train.py --batch_size 1000 --mode $MODE --normalize $NORMALIZE --model_id $MODEL_ID --lr_mode $LR_MODE --epochs $EPOCHS --dataset $DATASET --lr_max $LR_MAX --pseudo_labels $PSEUDO
batch_size - Batch Size for Test Set -default = 1000
mode - "Various attack strategies", type = str, default = 'teacher', choices = ['zero-shot', 'fine-tune', 'extract-label', 'extract-logit', 'distillation', 'teacher','independent','pre-act-18']
normalize  - The normalization is performed within the model and not in the dataloader to ease adversarial attack implementation. Please take note.
model_id - Used to compute location to load the model. See directory structure in code.
pseudo_labels - Used in case of label only model extraction
Generating Features
python generate_features.py --batch_size 500 --mode $MODE --normalize $NORMALIZE --model_id $MODEL_ID --dataset $DATASET --feature_type $FEATURE
batch_size - Batch Size for Test Set -default = 500
mode - "Various attack strategies", type = str, default = 'teacher', choices = ['zero-shot', 'fine-tune', 'extract-label', 'extract-logit', 'distillation', 'teacher','independent','pre-act-18']
normalize  - The normalization is performed within the model and not in the dataloader to ease adversarial attack implementation. Please take note.
model_id - Used to compute location to load the model. See directory structure in code.
feature_type - 'topgd', 'mingd', 'rand'. For black-box method use Random
