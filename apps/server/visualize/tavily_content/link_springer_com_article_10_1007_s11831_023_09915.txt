1 IntroductionNowadays, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL), are leading topics and centres of interest in the industry, academia, and popular culture all over the world [1, 1]. Machine learning has emerged as a popular field of study and cutting-edge tool in recent years. Multiple areas of prediction and decision-making benefit from its suite of algorithms and statistical techniques. The fact that it can use a variety of learning approaches means it can process large amounts of unstructured and complex data in ways that lead to revolutionary shifts in perspective based on the data experience.Different machine learning-based model has been applied in two ways: (1) Supervised learning, and (2) Unsupervised learning. The data are input into the supervised learning-based model, and then the model is used to perform classification, regression, and prediction on the labelled dataset [3,4,5]. In contrast, an unsupervised learning-based model is applied to unlabeled datasets to perform tasks such as clustering, dimensionality reduction of a dataset, detection, etc. Also, the concepts of machine learning are being applied in various industries; it is largely responsible for the revolutionary changes occurring in the healthcare industry. The majority of the time, it is utilized for the prediction of early-stage disease, the identification of disease, and the monitoring of the patient's status based on clinical datasets. Detecting automatic object features in medical images can also be accomplished by the use of machine learning techniques to datasets related to medical imaging. To manage picture collections and larger datasets, the deep neural network-based technique has emerged as the model of choice among the various machine learning models [6, 7]. Because it uses the three-layer perceptron for analyzing the dataset. Deep Neural Network-based approaches are a great solution in larger-scale datasets with different structures in fields of data mining, Image processing, Natural Language Processing, Expert Systems and Prediction, etc. [8, 9].The subfield of machine learning known as "deep learning" employs iterative methods for learning new features. It offers several neural network algorithm variants that can learn features in a variety of ways [10,11,12,13]. It is used on a huge scale and processed via numerous layers of filters. As a result of its use of multi-layer filtering techniques, it can deliver increasingly precise results compared to conventional machine learning while efficiently organizing massive datasets.Healthcare is the fastest expanding sector, drawing in more scientists, professors, and medical experts who are all eager to make important contributions to the discipline and the healthcare system as a whole. Hospitals, medical equipment, clinical trials, telemedicine, medical tourism, health insurance, and other related services are all examples of healthcare facilities. It presents a tremendous chance to enhance healthcare facilities with the use of cutting-edge technologies. Therefore, the development of more sophisticated technology has allowed for massive amounts of data and proven to be a massive transformation in healthcare fields, in terms of providing easy access to the best diagnostic tools, the most cutting-edge treatments, and a variety of minimally invasive procedures that result in less pain and quicker healing. Drug development, tailored treatment, robotic surgery, illness monitoring, etc. all rely heavily on healthcare in various capacities. A field's research dynamics and behaviours can be gleaned from scientific articles using bibliometric analysis, making it the most reliable tool for spotting patterns in the research landscape. Mathematical and statistical methods are used to research articles, books, and other forms of scholarly communication, and the results are used to analyze patterns in the scientific publishing world. Systematics examination of published sources is commonly used to gauge advancements in science across a range of disciplines using a variety of criteria.In this research, bibliometric analysis has been applied to analyze the most significant and crucial research pattern in machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and the healthcare field, as well as the most relevant research areas of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) application applying in the healthcare field. Also, explored the most related research areas of healthcare like disease detection, diagnosis, and prediction [14,15,16]. For this, Thomson Reuters’ Web of Science (WoS) (Clarivate analytics, 2020) database has been used to collect the bibliometric information in topic-wise and title-wise categories and “Machine learning”, “Deep Learning” and “Healthcare OR health*” used as query keywords. The web of science (WoS) database is a well-structured and differently indexed database, that selected only the most relevant top publication, it includes many significant scientific articles. Out of all relevant significant-top publication document types, only article, review, and early access articles have been selected for descriptive analysis. Another aspect of the bibliometric study is the following: number of published papers from 2010–2021; the number of authors; the number of papers per author and contribution; authors' collaboration; country-wise numbers of publications: country-wise paper impact factors; year-wise paper publication; top-most institution etc. Finally, we elected top categories to show the research dynamic, trends, hot topics, and research directions and variations on this related type of strategy have been successfully applied by the recent literature [14, 17, 18].Therefore, the purpose of this study is to give depth insight and a clear understanding of the research pattern of machine learning and deep learning application in the healthcare sector and compare the application of both techniques in the advancement of healthcare treatment. Hence, this study will be more beneficial for academia, and researchers’ health professionals to determine the relevant area of research in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Healthcare that has been broadly focused on along with the gaps that should be addressed. The paper is organized as (1) the “Introduction” section deals with the introduction of the topic. (2) “Methodology" section discusses the proposed methodology. (3) “Results and discussion” section provides the results and follows them with discussions. The “Summary” section deals with the summary of the whole work. (4) “Conclusion and prospect” section concludes and future scope of this work. (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Workflow diagramsFull size image2 Material and Methods2.1 Data CollectionFor this study, all bibliometric information has been collected using the text keyword search strategies in topical and title wise search from the Web of Science (WoS) database in machine learning and deep learning application in healthcare. The bibliometric information was searched only from Science Index-Expanded (SCI-Expanded) journal categories and retrieved complete data in plain text and BibTex data format, at global respect published literature during timespan 2010–2021(data accessed:31 august 2021). Then, filter the bibliometric information from Research articles, review articles, and early access articles from literature publication categories. Further, the bibliometric analysis method and network visualization methods were used to show the deep research trends and different levels of collaboration among scholars. In this context, the latest version of RStudio4.1.0 software was installed and then established the bibliometrics package [19] with R environment to perform descriptive bibliometric analysis and map the data. Then, the VOS viewer [20] open-source graphical user interface was used to demonstrate the show of different collaboration networks and bibliometric coupling based on retrieved bibliometric data.2.2 Finding From Bibliometric Data AnalysisTable 1 shows the data retrieved from the database with searched keywords such as: “machine learning”, “deep learning”, “healthcare”, “machine learning” AND “healthcare”, and “deep learning” AND “healthcare” in topical and title-wise categories. This table data shows that, in both the categories such title wise and topical wise categories, the highest literature published with the keyword healthcare (1,67,326), followed by machine learning (98,169) and deep learning (51,559). Likewise, in the application field respect, machine learning techniques have largely contributed to the healthcare domain more than deep learning techniques, which is shown by the literature data.Table 1 Total bibliometric data retrieved in categoriesFull size tableFigure 2 represented the bibliometric information between the numbers of publications vs categories. It also shows that topic-wise literature is more than title-wise, which is shown by the blue and orange colours.Fig. 2Statistics Of Categories Wise Data PatternFull size imageTable 2 illustrates the total literature published research documents in various types, then three types of documents i.e., research article, review, and early access article were selected in both topical and title-wise categories. In a topic-wise published scientific article, the highest numbers of published scientific articles with keywords healthcare (article:1,28,247, review:22,071, early access article:3,540), followed by machine learning (articles:86,292, review:5,794, early access:2,854), deep learning (articles:46,217, review:2,412, early access:2,130), machine learning in healthcare (articles:1,625, review:316), early access:98) and deep learning in healthcare articles (750), review (149), early access (74).Table 2 Total literature publication under different categories typeFull size tableWhereas, in title-wise published literature, the maximum number of research published with the keyword machine learning (article:22,935; review article:1,449; early access:22,935) followed by healthcare (articles:21,545; review article:2,730; early access:694), deep learning (articles:16,055; review article:730; early access:788), also machine learning in healthcare (articles:74; review article:11; early access:10) and deep learning in healthcare (articles:42; review article:5; early access:9). Figure 3 presents the statistical diagram, which demonstrates the published literature under different categories.Fig. 3Total literature publication under different categories typeFull size image2.3 Data Searching StrategiesThen, data searching strategies were used to systematically search bibliometric information in topical and title categories. For performing these tasks single and combinational text keywords were used “machine learning”,” deep learning”, “healthcare”, “machine learning” AND “healthcare” and “deep learning” AND “healthcare”. The task was executed to gather statistical facts, research patterns, and trends regarding machine learning, healthcare, also, the uses of machine learning methods related to the healthcare domain based on bibliometric information.Further, Inclusion parameters were set to include only peer-review literature from SCI-Extended journals available in the WoS database and described the machine learning, healthcare research area. From different categories of published articles in the WoS database, only three publication categories like research article, review article and early access article were included for this study in global respect. As Exclusion criteria, Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI), and literature published before the year 2010 were excluded. all country-specific selections were discarded from the parameters. Furthermore, an article published in Proceedings Paper, Book Chapter, editorial material, letter, correction, re-print, etc. were excluded.Furthermore, to understand the statistical research pattern in the application of machine learning and deep learning related to healthcare, bibliometric data were retrieved from the WoS database in a bibliography file (.bib) and plain text format (.txt). Both files included information like (i) Authors, (ii) Abstract, (iii) Addresses, (iv) ISSNs/ISBNs, (v) IDS numbers, (vi) Funding Information, (vii) PubMed IDs (viii) Titles (ix)Cited References, (x) Times Cited (xi) Cited Reference Counts, (xii) Language (xiii) Sources, (xiv) Documents Type, (xv) Keywords, (xvi) Source Abbreviations, (xvii) Author Identifiers, (xviii) Article Information, (xix) Publisher Information, (xx) Research Areas, (xxi) Usage Counts, and (xxii) Highly Cited.2.4 Methods UsedThe bibliometric analysis and Visualization method has gained immense popularity in research at present time. Because it provides the right direction to the research community, academia, and health professional based on depth knowledge of scientific publication patterns. This study included the top 20 latest publication patterns, domains, journals, authors, countries, organization research activities, and recent trending topics.For this, the Bibliometrix R package [19] is used for mathematical and statistical calculation of publication frequency, percentage, and citations of each author, journal, country, etc. A global collaboration map and other visualizations were done by open-source (corresponding information, author cooperation) VOS viewer [20] graphical user interface-based software, the tool was used for mapping of literature and analysis of author collaboration, country collaboration, etc. network visualization.3 Result and DiscussionBibliometric analysis has been conducted on the retrieved bibliometric data from all fields i.e., topic, title, abstract, affiliation, journal, etc. categorized by WoS core collection database in the research area of machine learning and deep learning application in the healthcare domain. To understand the various statistics of research trends in this research area, the latest relevant 1000 records have been selected among all available records from document-type research articles, review articles, and early access articles in SCI-Extended journals among globally available records.
