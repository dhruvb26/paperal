Machine Learning in Health and Biomedicine
Published August 21, 2019
Special Issues
Modern statistical modeling techniques—often called machine learning—are posited as a transformative force for human health. High-profile reports of diagnostic success demonstrate promise, but head-to-head comparisons to classical analyses of clinical data indicate that restraint is warranted. Practical questions are also timely. Will machine learning drive precision medicine? Will it elevate care in low-resource settings? How will the clinician interact with the machine? In this Collection, PLOS ONE, PLOS Computational Biology, PLOS Medicine and our teams of Guest Editors will feature research that applies machine learning methods to health and biomedicine. These articles will be accompanied by expert commentary on the application, impact, and ethics of these approaches.
