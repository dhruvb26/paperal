ML is a subtype of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology that aims to improve the speed and accuracy of physicians' work. Countries are currently dealing with an overburdened healthcare system with a shortage of skilled physicians, where AI provides a big hope. The healthcare data can be used gainfully to identify the optimal trial sample, collect more data points, assess ongoing data from trial participants, and eliminate data-based errors. ML-based techniques assist in detecting early indicators of an epidemic or pandemic. This algorithm examines satellite data, news and social media reports, and even video sources to determine whether the sickness will become out of control. Using ML for healthcare can open up a world of possibilities in this field. It frees up healthcare providers' time to focus on patient care rather than searching or entering information. This paper studies ML and its need in healthcare, and then it discusses the associated features and appropriate pillars of ML for healthcare structure. Finally, it identified and discussed the significant applications of ML for healthcare. The applications of this technology in healthcare operations can be tremendously advantageous to the organisation. ML-based tools are used to provide various treatment alternatives and individualised treatments and improve the overall efficiency of hospitals and healthcare systems while lowering the cost of care. Shortly, ML will impact both physicians and hospitals. It will be crucial in developing clinical decision support, illness detection, and personalised treatment approaches to provide the best potential outcomes.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsMachine learningDataHealthcarePatient outcomeEfficiencyTreatmentRecommended articlesCited by (0)© 2022 The Authors.
