For instance, stereotypes often\nspan a full sentence beginning with a generalization, to\nwhich some unfairness is assigned.\n3.2.1 Model Architecture The GUS-Net model is\na multi-label token classification system designed to\nidentify social bias across three categories: generaliza-\ntions, unfairness, and stereotypes. It outputs seven la-\nbels, allowing the model to capture the nuanced struc-\nture of biased language. These labels facilitate the iden-\ntification of individual bias categories, and provide flex-\nibility for overlapping and nested biases.\nCopyright © 2025 by SIAM\nUnauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\n\nPage 5\nInput Processing. We tokenize all sentences us-\ning the pre-trained BERT tokenizer, ensuring that token\nsplits (such as sub-words) inherit the correct entity la-\nbels from the parent word. Each text sequence is padded\nto a maximum length of 128 tokens to ensure consistent\ninput size. Since sentences are rarely longer than 128\ntokens, we reduced the BERT input size from the de-\nfault 512 tokens, representing a 16x reduction in self-\nattention elements to be processed. Correspondingly,\nthe NER tags were converted into a (128, 7) dimensional\nvector, where each of the seven elements represents a bi-\nnary label (0 or 1) for the respective entity type. These\nvectors were padded with −100 values up to the full se-\nquence length of 128 tokens, with the −100 values being\nignored during the loss calculation.\nModel Fine-Tuning. We fine-tune the\npre-trained transformer model, specifically\nbert-base-uncased, due to its ability to capture\ndeep contextual relationships between words, which\nis crucial for identifying implicit biases [10]. BERT’s\nbidirectional nature allows it to process the entire\ninput sequence, ensuring that each token is evaluated\nin the context of its surrounding words. This feature is\nparticularly valuable in detecting subtle and complex\nforms of social bias.\nThe model is implemented using the Hugging Face\ntransformers library. Input text is tokenized with\nthe pre-trained BERT tokenizer, which breaks down\nsentences into sub-word units while preserving word\nboundaries. Each token sequence is padded to a length\nof 128 tokens, and the corresponding labels are mapped\nto ensure proper alignment. By reducing the input\nsize from the default 512 tokens to 128, we optimize\nthe model’s computational efficiency without sacrificing\nperformance for typical sentence lengths in the dataset.\n3.2.2 Loss Function Given the significant class im-\nbalance in our dataset, where certain entities like\nSTEREO are underrepresented compared to frequent\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
