This approach\nimproves upon traditional methods by combining LLM\nreasoning and the powerful contextual embeddings pro-\nvided by pre-trained models, resulting in more accu-\nrate and comprehensive bias detection across various\ntypes of text. Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques in terms of dataset diversity and annotation\ndepth. The fine-tuned model not only achieves superior\nperformance on traditional metrics, such as accuracy\nand F1-score but also provides a more nuanced under-\nstanding of the biases present in various texts. The main\ncontributions of this paper are:\n• We generate a corpus containing biases in varied\ndomains, annotated by a team of LLM agents.\n• We train an NLP model for multi-label named-\nentity recognition, enhancing bias detection speci-\nficity and insight. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to provides token-level multi-\nlabel bias detection.\n• We conduct experiments to demonstrate the con-\ntributions of our methods in relation to existing\napproaches, showcasing improvements in accuracy,\nF1-score, and the depth of bias detection.\n2 Related Works\nThe detection of bias in natural language processing\n(NLP) is a critical area of research, particularly given\nthe increasing use of large language models (LLMs)\nacross various domains [7, 9, 33, 18, 8, 29, 30]. Tradi-\ntional techniques for bias detection often rely on human\nannotators to label datasets. While this approach has\nbeen instrumental in creating foundational resources,\nit is inherently limited by the annotators’ subjective\nperspectives, which can introduce their own biases into\nthe annotation process [25, 26]. This limitation often\nleads to a narrow understanding of bias, especially in\nregard to implicit biases that are subtle and context-\ndependent [13, 14, 28].\n2.1 Ethical Dataset Construction The construc-\ntion of ethical datasets for bias detection is essential\nfor ensuring comprehensive and fair analyses. Existing\ndatasets often suffer from limitations in scope, failing\nto encompass the broad spectrum of biases and per-\nspectives necessary for effective bias detection. For ex-\nample, the Dbias model [26] utilized the MBIC dataset,\nwhich consists of a relatively small number of sentences,\nrestricting the model’s ability to generalize across dif-\nferent domains and types of bias. Although the NBias\nframework [25] expanded the use of named-entity recog-\nnition (NER) by introducing the entity “BIAS” it still\nprimarily addressed explicit biases and overlooked the\nstructural elements of implicit bias, such as stereotypes\nand generalizations.\nMoreover, studies that emphasize robust annota-\ntions often rely on human judgment, which can lead\nto a lack of diversity in viewpoints necessary to capture\nthe nuance of implicit bias [27]. This reliance on hu-\nman annotators may also perpetuate the biases present\nin society, resulting in datasets that do not adequately\nrepresent the full range of perspectives. Thus, there\nis a pressing need for more diverse and comprehensive\ndatasets that can capture implicit biases in language.\n2.2 Bias Detection Traditional methods typically\nfocus on explicit bias, which is easier to define and iden-\ntify, while neglecting the subtler forms of bias that may\ninfluence public perception and decision-making. Im-\nplicit bias can manifest through word choice, framing,\nand the omission of certain viewpoints, making it chal-\nlenging to detect using conventional approaches [13, 14].\nExisting frameworks, such as Dbias and Nbias, have\nmade strides in bias detection but still focus primarily\non explicit biases, leaving a gap in the understanding of\nhow implicit biases operate [26, 25]. Additionally, the\ndatasets used for these frameworks often lack the neces-\nsary diversity of perspectives, limiting their effectiveness\nin identifying implicit biases. In contrast, our proposed\napproach leverages generative AI and automated agents\nto construct a more comprehensive dataset. By utilizing\nsynthetic data generated by these agents, we enhance\nthe training of the pre-trained model BERT for multi-\nlabel token classification. This innovative methodology\nnot only improves the specificity and depth of bias de-\ntection but also addresses the limitations of existing\ndatasets, paving the way for more accurate and nuanced\nunderstanding of biases in various texts.\n3 Methodology\n3.1 Dataset Generation With modern synthetic\ntraining data labeling techniques, we can create a\ncomprehensive dataset encapsulating our novel entities\nCopyright © 2025 by SIAM\nUnauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\n\nPage 3\nTable 1: Detailed list of arguments for corpus creation.\nType Of Bias Target Statement TypeSentiment\nRacial [white people, black people, asian people, hispanic people, indigenous people, ...]\nReligious [christians, muslims, jewish people, hindus, buddhists, sikhs, atheists, agnostics\nGender [men, women, boys, girls, females, males, non-binary people, ...]\nAge [children, teenagers, young people, middle aged people, old people, ...]\nNationality[immigrants, refugees, people from developing countries, people from Western countries, ...]\nSexuality [straight people, gay people, bisexual people, asexual people, LGBTQIA+ people, ...]\nSocioeconomic[working class people, middle class people, upper class people, poor people, rich people, ...]\nEducational [uneducated people, highly educated people, people with non-traditional education, ...]\nDisability [people with physical disabilities, people in wheelchairs, people with mental\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a pre-trained model used for multi-label token classification to improve bias detection across various types of text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LLM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Large Language Models (LLMs) are utilized in NLP for various tasks, including bias detection and enhancing the accuracy and depth of bias analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NLP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of study focused on the interaction between computers and human languages, particularly in processing and analyzing large amounts of natural language data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DBIAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Dbias is a model that utilizes the MBIC dataset for bias detection, primarily focusing on explicit biases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NBIAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NBias is a framework that expands named-entity recognition (NER) to include the entity “BIAS”, addressing explicit biases and aiming to detect implicit biases)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BERT<|>LLM<|>BERT is a type of Large Language Model used specifically for improving bias detection in NLP<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NLP<|>LLM<|>NLP increasingly uses Large Language Models like BERT for tasks such as bias detection<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DBIAS<|>NBIAS<|>Both Dbias and Nbias are frameworks developed for detecting biases in text, with Nbias expanding upon Dbias's approach<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
