Each token sequence is padded to a length\nof 128 tokens, and the corresponding labels are mapped\nto ensure proper alignment. By reducing the input\nsize from the default 512 tokens to 128, we optimize\nthe model’s computational efficiency without sacrificing\nperformance for typical sentence lengths in the dataset.\n3.2.2 Loss Function Given the significant class im-\nbalance in our dataset, where certain entities like\nSTEREO are underrepresented compared to frequent\nentities like O, we employed focal loss to address this\nchallenge [22]. Standard binary cross-entropy (BCE)\ntends to focus on the majority class, leading to poor\nperformance on rare classes. In this paper, we use fo-\ncal loss calculated over all tokens, defined as:\nFL(pt) = −αt(1 − pt)γ log(pt)\nwhere pt is the predicted probability for the true class;\n(1 −pt)γ reduces the impact of well-classified examples,\nhelping the model prioritize rare or difficult examples; α\nbalances the contribution of positive and negative sam-\nples, ensuring underrepresented entities receive more fo-\ncus; γ down-weights well-classified examples, allowing\nthe model to concentrate on harder-to-predict instances.\n4 Experiments\n4.1 Settings\nTask Description and Metrics. In this paper,\nwe performed a token-level multi-label classification\ntask, where each sentence is annotated with one or more\nlabels to facilitate the identification of biased entities\nacross token sequences. Token-level classification is es-\nsential for bias detection because biases can often be\nnuanced and context-dependent. By focusing on indi-\nvidual tokens, we can capture subtle implications and\nassociations that may be overlooked in a sentence-level\nanalysis. Moreover, we opted for multi-label classifica-\ntion instead of multi-class classification to better reflect\nthe complex nature of biases, that may fall into one or\nmany entity classes. A single-class approach, like the\none proposed for Nbias, would limit our ability to cap-\nture the diversity of biases present in the text, as a\nstatement may contain multiple biases simultaneously.\nMetrics. To evaluate the model’s performance, we\nutilized a variety of metrics to assess its ability to\naccurately identify biased entities:\n• Hamming Loss: This metric measures the frac-\ntion of incorrect labels over all tokens in the se-\nquence, accounting for multi-label classification. It\nis defined as:\nHamming Loss = 1\nL\nLX\ni=1\n1 (yi ̸= ˆyi)\nwhere L is the total number of tokens, yi is the\ntrue label for the i-th token, ˆyi is the predicted\nlabel, and 1 is an indicator function that evaluates\nwhether the true label differs from the prediction.\n• Precision, Recall, and F1-Score: These metrics\nwere calculated at two levels: individually for\neach entity class and as a macro-average across all\nclasses. They are defined as follows:\nPrecision = T P\nT P+ F P, Recall = T P\nT P+ F N\nF1-Score = 2 · Precision · Recall\nPrecision + Recall\nwhere TP denotes true positives, FP denotes false\npositives, and FN denotes false negatives.\nGiven the imbalanced class distribution in our\ndataset, we evaluated both the macro-average perfor-\nmance of the model and individual entity-type-level\nmetrics. By treating B- and I- tags as a single entity\n(e.g., combining B-GEN and I-GEN predictions), we en-\nhance our evaluation of the model’s ability to detect the\nCopyright © 2025 by SIAM\nUnauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\n\nPage 6\nTable 3: Baseline Comparison of GUS-Net over Nbias w.r.t. both overall and entity-type-based F1, Precision and\nRecall.
