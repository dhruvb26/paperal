Bias can\nsignificantly influence public perception and decision-\nmaking, often subtly reinforcing stereotypes or prop-\n∗Ethical Spectacle Research.\n†Arizona State University.\nagating discriminatory practices. While explicit bias,\nwhich refers to clearly expressed prejudice or favoritism,\nis easy to define, implicit bias involves more subtle and\noften unconscious associations or attitudes. Therefore,\nidentifying and mitigating implicit bias in the text is\nchallenging: what is perceived as biased can vary greatly\ndepending on the context, including the perspectives of\nviewers and speakers. For example, consider the phrase\n“hard-working immigrants”. To some, this phrase may\nappear positive, acknowledging the effort and diligence\nof immigrants. However, from another perspective, it\nmight be perceived as implicitly biased, suggesting that\nimmigrants are expected to work harder than others to\nbe valued or accepted. This subtle implication can be\nseen as reinforcing a stereotype that separates immi-\ngrants from native citizens, placing an undue burden of\nproof on their worthiness. This subjectivity underlines\nthe complexity of implicit bias detection, making it a\ncritical area of research within NLP [14, 28, 25].\nWhile the implicit nature of bias can manifest in\nsubtle forms, such as the choice of words, framing of\nnarratives, or the omission of certain viewpoints, tradi-\ntional approaches to bias detection have typically re-\nlied on human annotators to label datasets [25, 26].\nAlthough this method has been essential for creating\nfoundational resources, it is susceptible to the biases of\nannotators, who may struggle to step outside their own\nideological frameworks. As a result, existing datasets of-\nten lack the diversity of viewpoints necessary to capture\nimplicit biases effectively. Additionally, many datasets,\nsuch as the one utilized by the Dbias model [32], are\nlimited in scope, focusing on a narrow range of biases\nand failing to generalize across different contexts. The\nNbias framework [25], while an advancement in incor-\nporating named entity recognition (NER) tasks, still\nemphasizes explicit biases and overlooks the structural\nelements of implicit bias, such as generalizations and\nstereotypes. Despite studies of robust annotations con-\nducted by trained experts [27], all the previous bias\ndatasets rely on human annotators, which means that\nthese datasets often lack the diversity of viewpoints nec-\nCopyright © 2025 by SIAM\nUnauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited\narXiv:2410.08388v2  [cs.CL]  17 Oct 2024\n\nPage 2\nessary to capture implicit bias.\nIn response to these challenges, this paper intro-\nduces the Generalizations, Unfairness, and Stereotypes\nNetwork (GUS-Net), which stands for three kinds of\nbiases that are commonly considered in legal and psy-\nchological literature [1, 3, 12, 21]: Generalizations,\nUnfairness, and Stereotypes. GUS-Net leverages gen-\nerative AI and automated agents to build an optimal\ndataset for bias detection. Using the synthetic data\ngenerated by these automated agents, we further fine-\ntune the pre-trained model BERT (Bidirectional En-\ncoder Representations from Transformers) [10] for the\ntask of multi-label token classification. This approach\nimproves upon traditional methods by combining LLM\nreasoning and the powerful contextual embeddings pro-\nvided by pre-trained models, resulting in more accu-\nrate and comprehensive bias detection across various\ntypes of text. Our extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art\ntechniques in terms of dataset diversity and annotation\ndepth.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}}
