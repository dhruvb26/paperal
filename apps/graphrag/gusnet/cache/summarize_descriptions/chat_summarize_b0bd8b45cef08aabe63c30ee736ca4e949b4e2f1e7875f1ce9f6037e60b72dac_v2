Developed using a multi-label token classification architecture based on bert-base-uncased, GUS-Net is specifically tailored for identifying various biases, including generalizations, unfairness, and stereotypes. It excels in the multi-label classification of token-level bias within the GUS dataset, demonstrating improved performance over its predecessor, Nbias, across several metrics such as F1 score, Precision, and Recall. GUS-Net represents an innovative approach to bias detection in natural language processing by leveraging generative AI and automated agents to create a comprehensive synthetic dataset. This dataset enables robust multi-label token classification, making GUS-Net a leading solution in the field for effectively capturing and addressing social biases in text.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1734484901, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 186, "prompt_tokens": 296, "total_tokens": 482, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
