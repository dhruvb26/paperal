GUS-Net was developed as an improvement over NBIAS, aiming to enhance the accuracy and efficiency in identifying biases within texts. Comparative analyses between the two have demonstrated that GUS-Net exhibits superior performance in bias detection across several metrics. This indicates that GUS-Net's approach to token-level bias classification is more effective than that of NBIAS, making it a significant advancement in the efforts to mitigate bias in textual data.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1734484907, "model": "gpt-4-0125-preview", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 114, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 288, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
